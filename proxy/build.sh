# Build the Atlas reverse proxy stack — run INSIDE a freshly-provisioned Ubuntu
# guest (proxy-design.md §3.1). Installs the stock nginx binary from the official
# nginx.org apt repo, then compiles ONLY the modules apt cannot supply (OpenResty
# luajit2 + the Lua/headers-more nginx modules, as dynamic .so's built against the
# exact installed nginx), installs the committed conf/lua/html and the guest unit
# at the stock `nginx`-package paths (/usr/sbin/nginx, /etc/nginx, /var/log/nginx,
# …), and enables nginx.service. The built VM is then snapshotted by Atlas — that
# snapshot is the reusable "proxy image".
#
# Why apt for the base, source for the modules: installing the real nginx from
# nginx.org's repo gives us a signed apt transaction that OWNS the stock paths,
# makes `nginx -V` genuinely truthful, ships current stable nginx + an OpenSSL we
# don't hand-build, and keeps the base off the C toolchain. The modules (luajit2,
# lua-nginx, headers-more) ship in NO apt repo, so they stay compiled — but as
# dynamic modules (`--add-dynamic-module`, `--with-compat`) loaded by the apt
# binary via `load_module` in nginx.conf. We own the frozen, mutually-compatible
# MODULE set; apt owns the base binary + OpenSSL version.
#
# This is the AUTHORITATIVE build. The docker-compose test harness (proxy/test)
# runs this same script so the tested stack and the shipped stack are identical.
#
# Idempotent (spec taste #14: retry = re-run). Re-running reinstalls the held apt
# nginx and rebuilds the modules from the pinned sources; already-present source
# tarballs are reused.
#
# Run as root. Reads the committed tree from the directory this script lives in.
