# Custom-domain SNI-passthrough release gate (spec/12 § The stream front-door, spec/13
# § Custom domains, spec/18 Phase 2). Drives the running docker-compose stack to prove
# the proxy's :443 SNI fork and :80 ACME fork against a real TLS-terminating backend
# (tls-vm, which holds its OWN cert):
#
#   - a custom SNI in the `domains` map is PASSED THROUGH raw to the backend's :443, and
#     the cert the client sees is the BACKEND's (CN=tls-vm.custom.example), NOT the proxy
#     wildcard — proof the proxy never decrypted;
#   - the negotiated SNI survives the strip-path (echoed back by the backend);
#   - a NAMED custom SNI NOT in the map terminates on the dummy cert and serves the
#     branded "Domain not configured" page (404); an EMPTY SNI is still dropped at L4;
#   - a wildcard SNI still terminates AT the proxy (the L7 path is unregressed);
#   - the :80 ACME fork: a custom host's /.well-known/acme-challenge/ reaches the VM,
#     a wildcard host's is served LOCALLY (the wildcard guard).
#
# Run the stack first:  docker compose up --build -d
# Then:                 python3 -m pytest test_custom_domain_proxy.py -v
