# Security model

This guide records what protects an Atlas region today, and which decisions are accepted for now. Read it before you change authentication, permissions, or the tenant boundary.

## Trust boundaries

Atlas trusts the central control plane, the Metal hosts it provisions, and its own object storage. It does not trust an API caller, a guest virtual machine, or a proxy viewer.

The Atlas API at `/api/atlas` is the only tenant-facing surface. Metal Servers, provider credentials, and bare metal operations stay with a System Manager.

## Who can call the API

A service caller needs a valid Central or regional Atlas token. Send the token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. A System Manager can also use the Atlas API.

The authentication validator closes the standard Frappe guest surface. A guest can sign in, read the API reference or public key set, and read a public file under `/files/`, which is how a Metal host downloads the published binaries and boot artifacts. The realtime console stays open because its handshake and permission calls need the web process. A session without a verified token cannot use an Atlas API route.

Atlas requires the `iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `scope`, `tenant`, `iat`, and `exp` claims. It checks `nbf` when the claim is present. The audience is `atlas-admin:<region ID>`. The API surface is unrestricted, so the token needs `scope=*`, a subject, a tenant, and no resource constraint. The subject is an identity label and does not change the authority. The `tenant` claim carries the tenant boundary. Central uses `tenant=*`.

The authentication hook is the one access gate. It signs the caller in, stores the request identity, and refuses a path that the caller may not use. A route function performs no access check of its own.

Atlas binds each key namespace to its issuer. A `central:*` key can validate only `iss=central`. The regional key can validate only `iss=atlas:<region ID>`. A regional token cannot claim Central authority.

Atlas gets Central public keys every 5 minutes. It keeps the last valid key set after a fetch failure. Atlas publishes these keys and its regional public key at `/api/atlas/jwks.json`. An unknown key ID does not cause a fetch.

## Tenant isolation

Each tenant record carries a `tenant_id`. The `tenant` claim of the token decides the tenant of a request. Atlas signs a regional caller in as `tenant-<tenant ID>@atlas.local` and creates that user on first use, so the tenant belongs to the authenticated user and not to a request header. A Central caller (`tenant=*`) is not bound to one tenant and sends `X-Tenant-ID`.

The Frappe permission hooks are the enforcement point. `permission_query_conditions` filters each list query and `has_permission` checks each document, both for `Virtual Machine`, `Virtual Machine Image`, and `Metal Server IP Address`. A list route uses `frappe.get_list`, so the hook applies. `get_owned_document` applies the same rule to a single resource and returns `404` for a record of another tenant. Outside an Atlas API request there is no identity, so a caller without the System Manager role reads nothing.

A System image is the one shared record. Every tenant can read, boot, and download it. Only its owner can write or delete an image it owns.

A snapshot request carries `image_type`. Only tenant `0` may ask for `system`, and only tenant `0` may set the `cache_image` and `memory_snapshot` flags. Any other tenant that sends one of these values receives an error, and the default image type is `machine`. All 3 values are set at creation, and no route changes them later.

Tenant `0` is the system tenant. A privileged virtual machine reaches every tenant through the mesh, so it must use tenant `0`, and only a caller that acts for tenant `0` can create one or hold the privileged flag. An unallocated IP address carries tenant `-1`, so no tenant can read it.

## Accepted risks

**A service token is a bearer token.** Atlas does not track replay. A stolen token works until it expires, so each issuer must use a short lifetime.

**There are no tenant quotas.** A caller can create virtual machines and reserve provider IP addresses without a tenant limit. VM shape validation limits CPU entitlement to 100 through 32000 millicores, but it does not limit aggregate use. Cost and aggregate capacity control belong to the central control plane, not to Atlas.

**The API reference page loads a script from a CDN.** `/api/atlas/docs` is unauthenticated and serves Scalar from `cdn.jsdelivr.net` without a pinned version or an integrity hash. The page shares an origin with the site, so a compromised CDN would run in the browser of a signed-in viewer. Pin the version and add an integrity hash, or serve the bundle from the app.

**A signed image download URL lives for 24 hours.** The URL is a bearer capability for that artifact. Atlas sets `Cache-Control: no-store`, but a caller can pass the URL on.

**A console token is a bearer capability.** It is a 48-character value that expires after 60 seconds and is single use. The realtime handler accepts it from a guest, because the token is the only credential the console needs.

## Future work

**The Atlas API has no resource scopes.** A token carries `scope=*` and reaches every tenant API route. The HTTP proxy already binds a token to resource scopes and name constraints. Add the same model here when one caller must reach fewer routes than another.

## Rules for a change

A list route must use `frappe.get_list`. `frappe.get_all` ignores permissions and must not appear in a route.

Keep an API route thin. Put the permission check on the domain object, so a whitelisted method is safe on its own. A route is a second line of defence, not the only one.

Do not return a Frappe message to a caller unless the message is written for a caller. Raise `AtlasUserError` for a message that a caller may read. Every other failure returns a generic message for its status, and Atlas logs the traceback.

Run a queued job as Administrator with `run_as_admin`. A job must not depend on the permissions of the user that enqueued it, and it must not run inside a request.
