# the operator via token auth — so there is no end-user row-level scoping here.

# when self-serve signup moved to Central; see spec/14-self-serve.md.)

# Document Events
# ---------------
# Report VM lifecycle events to Central (spec/16-central.md § Event reporting).
# Handlers enqueue a background POST gated on Central Settings.enabled, so a site
# without Central configured pays nothing and a delivery failure never blocks the
# operation.

# Scheduled Tasks
# ---------------
# Daily TLS renewal: renew every Active certificate whose expiry is within the
# renewal window (re-issue AND re-push to the region's proxies), mirroring the
# proxy reconcile philosophy — the desired state (a fresh cert on every proxy) is
# continuously restored. See spec/13-tls.md.
#
# NOTE — bench self-service subdomain routing (spec/18) is **one-way push**: the guest
# register/deregister/lists its OWN routes over its egress and the controller writes
# inline (the Subdomain hooks reconcile the proxy). There is deliberately **no
# scheduled SSH pull and no sweeper** — teardown is `VirtualMachine.terminate()` alone
# (Component F, total). Do NOT add a `reconcile_*`/`sweep_*` scheduler entry for it; a
# scheduled scan was removed when the model went push-only (the unit test asserts this
# list carries none).

# NOTE — the cron entry below is a PROVISIONING reconciler, unrelated to the
# spec/18 routing-sweeper prohibition above. `provision()` creates a billing
# vendor box synchronously, then a single fire-and-forget finish_provisioning
# job adopts it; if that job is lost the Server strands pre-Active with a
# paid-for box behind it and nothing notices. This sweep re-drives such rows.
# Do NOT delete it citing the "no sweeper" rule — that rule is scoped to bench
# self-routing, not server provisioning. See spec/03-bootstrapping.md.
