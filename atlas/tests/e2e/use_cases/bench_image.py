"""Operator action (and host-bound proof): bake the golden bench image.

Provisions a plain Ubuntu VM, builds bench-cli + `bench init` inside it over
guest-SSH (`atlas.atlas.bench_image.build_bench`), stops it, and snapshots it.
That snapshot is the reusable "golden bench image" self-serve site VMs clone
from (`Virtual Machine Snapshot.clone_to_new_vm`) — the build-in-guest +
snapshot pattern the proxy uses, applied to bench (plans/self-serve/01).

This is the ONE host fact plan 01 exists to prove (plan 01 "How it's proven"):
a VM baked this way actually has a working bench — `bench --version` responds
over guest-SSH after the build. Everything else about the image (the routing
identity, the site) is per-VM and lives in plan 03's deploy-site.py.

It is billable: one droplet + one Firecracker VM (kept Stopped after the
snapshot, so it can be re-baked, or terminated once the snapshot exists). Run on
the operator's turn:

    bench --site atlas.tests.local execute \
        atlas.tests.e2e.use_cases.bench_image.run

`run_smoke` reuses the shared bootstrapped droplet (cheap); `run` provisions a
brand-new server. Both leave the snapshot row + its LV in place — that is the
artifact. Teardown when done:

    bench --site atlas.tests.local execute \
        atlas.tests.e2e.use_cases.bench_image.teardown \
        --kwargs '{"virtual_machine": "<vm-name>"}'
