"""Use case: migrate a Virtual Machine's disk between hosts, keeping its identity.

Operator clicks **Migrate** on a VM form (target picker); the scheduled
`reconcile_migrations` callback advances the resumable phase row to Done. This is
COLD migration — the guest is stopped during cutover and (stage 1, change-address)
gets a NEW public IPv6 on the target; the UUID and everything derived from it
(MAC/tap/netns/uid) re-materialize identically, and the SSH host keys are PRESERVED
so the VM's SSH identity survives the move. See spec/19-vm-migration.md.

This is a **dedicated-two-droplet** host fact — it needs a source AND a target
Server, both Active and same-provider — so it owns its own droplets and is invoked
directly, NOT folded into `run_all_smoke` (the same shape as `server_provisioning`
and `tls_issuance`). Cost: up to two billable droplets (it reuses any Active pair).

What it proves — the host facts only a real cross-host move can:
  1. All 8 phases advance Pending→…→Done via the scheduler driver, idempotently.
  2. The migrated VM row repoints to the target server + a NEW /128 in the target's
     range, status Running.
  3. The guest BOOTS on the target (unit active, TCP 22 open on the new /128).
  4. The VM's SSH host key is BYTE-IDENTICAL before and after (identity survived).
  5. The source copy is fully torn down (unit inactive, disk + -migrate snaps gone).

Two scenarios, one per address scheme (each owns the two-droplet harness):
  - `run_smoke` — CHANGE-address (the Self-Managed fallback / non-forwardable path):
    the VM gets a NEW /128 on the target and the proxy re-points. Facts 1-5 above.
  - `run_keep_address_smoke` — KEEP-address (spec/19 §2.9, stage 3): the VM keeps
    its /128; the source host keeps holding the /64 and forwards the address to the
    target over a per-VM tunnel, with the guest's replies policy-routed back up it.
    Then Collapse-forward moves it to a new /128 and tears the tunnel down.

TRANSPORT (this build): plain-TCP NBD + plain-TCP socat tunnel carrier (no SSH
tunnel yet — a secure host-to-host carrier is a deferred follow-up). The unit suite
(test_virtual_machine_migration.py) owns the phase-order, pre-flight, immutability/
retry, flags.migrating-gate, capability-gate, and lifecycle-guard logic in
milliseconds; this module is only the host facts.
