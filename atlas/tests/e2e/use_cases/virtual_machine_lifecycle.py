"""Use case: operate a running Firecracker VM.

Operator clicks Start / Stop / Restart / Terminate. Each is one Task
(`start-vm.py`, `snapshot-stop-vm.py` — the default memory-capturing stop —
`stop-vm.py`, `terminate-vm.py`); Restart is `stop` + `start` orchestrated in
Python, not a separate script.

This module exercises:

- Auto-provision (insert -> Running) -> Stop -> Start -> Restart ->
  Terminate, with a probe on every state.
- The memory-snapshot fast path on the way: the default stop captures the
  guest's memory (`has_memory_snapshot`), and the next start RESUMES it
  instead of cold-booting (the start Task reports "restored from memory
  snapshot") — the host fact only a real Firecracker round trip can prove.
- Terminate again from Terminated throws.

(Phase 4 dropped the Pending state guards from this use case — auto-provision
fires from `after_insert`, so a freshly-inserted VM races to Running and
won't dwell in Pending long enough for an operator to mis-click anyway. The
controller still enforces the guards in `start()` / `stop()` / `restart()`;
those branches are exercised by the unit-test suite.)
