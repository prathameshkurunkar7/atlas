"""Use case: run a script over SSH against a host.

Atlas's lowest-level primitive is `run_task(connection=..., script=..., variables=...)`,
which uploads a script over scp and runs it over ssh. It is what
`Server.bootstrap()` uses before a `Server` row's provider linkage is usable.

[run_against_shared](#run_against_shared) exercises `upload_files`,
`wait_for_ssh`, `run_scp`, and `Server.bootstrap()` re-run against the
shared bootstrapped server used by `run_all`. The happy/failure/missing-script
paths of `run_task` itself live in the `run_task` use case.

Also folds in the argument-validation throws that guard the entry point
(`run_task` requires exactly one of `server=` or `connection=`,
`connection_for_server` requires `ipv4_address`, `execute_task` requires
a Task with a `server`). These do not require a droplet at all; they
ride along on this entry point.
