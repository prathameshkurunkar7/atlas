"""Use case: attach a Reserved IP to a VM and prove inbound + egress v4.

This is the host-bound proof of the inbound-v4 primitive (spec/06-networking.md
"IPv4 ingress"). Only a real droplet can show it, so it lives in the e2e suite,
not the unit tests (the rule generation + the attach/detach invariant are
unit-covered in milliseconds; see scripts/lib/atlas/test_reserved_ip_nat.py and
atlas/atlas/doctype/reserved_ip/test_reserved_ip.py).

What it proves, end to end, with a REAL DigitalOcean reserved IP:

- **Inbound DNAT** — from OFF the droplet (the controller, i.e. wherever this
  test runs, over the public v4 internet), reach the reserved IPv4 on the guest's
  sshd `:22` and run `hostname`, asserting it returns *this* guest's
  `atlas-<uuid8>`. That is the production path: external client → DO edge →
  droplet anchor → host PREROUTING DNAT → guest. A host-local curl would skip
  PREROUTING, so the vantage must be off-droplet — the controller is.
- **Egress SNAT** — from inside the guest (hopped in over its v6), curl an
  external v4 echo and assert the observed source is the reserved IP, not the
  host's shared masquerade address (phase-reserved-ip-snat.sh).

It allocates and releases a real reserved IP, so teardown is in a `finally`:
detach (tears down the host NAT + unbinds at the vendor) then release (destroys
the vendor IP). Leaving one attached would strand a billable address.
