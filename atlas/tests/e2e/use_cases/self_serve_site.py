"""Use case: signup → email verify → live Frappe site, end to end.

The superset host-bound proof of the self-serve site layer
(spec/14-self-serve.md). It consumes everything
the other tracks built — the golden bench snapshot, the `Site` doctype, the
`deploy-site.py` + readiness gate, the signup/verify on-ramp — PLUS the already
proven proxy + TLS layers, and drives the whole flow on a real droplet:

    signup (request_site)  →  Site Request (Pending), NO Site/VM   (Contract C)
        ↓ verify()
    User + Site (owner = verified user)                            (Contract C)
        ↓ Site.after_insert → auto_provision (worker)
    clone golden snapshot → boot → deploy-site.py → HTTP 200       (01/03, Contract B)
        ↓
    Subdomain row → proxy reconcile → live at acme.<region>.<domain>
        ↓
    off-droplet HTTPS on v4 (reserved IP) AND v6 (proxy /128)      (the idea-doc requirement)

What ONLY a live run can prove (everything below is unit-covered otherwise — the
Site state machine in test_site.py, the validators in test_subdomain_label.py,
the signup ordering in test_api_signup.py):

- **The golden image actually serves.** A VM cloned from 01's snapshot, after
  03's deploy-site.py, answers HTTP 200 on :80 for its Host header — the full
  bake → clone → boot → deploy chain survives onto a fresh per-site VM.
- **The readiness signal is real.** The Site flips to Running only on an observed
  200 (Contract B), driven by the real `auto_provision` worker job, not on the
  VM's status.
- **The proxy routes the new subdomain end to end.** Once auto_provision creates
  the Subdomain, an OFF-droplet request to https://<sub>.<region>.<domain> reaches
  the site through the proxy — over BOTH the reserved IPv4 and public IPv6.
- **Verification gates provision (Contract C).** request_site creates a Pending
  Site Request and NOTHING billable (no Site, no VM) until verify() consumes the
  token.

Cost: the proxy_vm infra (one shared droplet, a proxy VM, one reserved IPv4) PLUS
a real ACME issuance against a real Route 53 zone (LE staging) PLUS a golden-image
site VM cloned + deployed. It needs the TLS config keys (`atlas_tls_*`, see
`_config.get_tls_config`), certbot + boto3 on the controller, and a golden bench
snapshot (resolved from Atlas Settings, or baked inline if absent). Absent any of
those it raises before any billable provision (MissingConfig / a clear preflight
error), mirroring tls_issuance.

    bench --site atlas.tests.local execute \
        atlas.tests.e2e.use_cases.self_serve_site.run_smoke

It is NOT folded into `run_all_smoke`: it needs a live AWS zone, an ACME round
trip, and a special golden snapshot, so it owns its run like tls_issuance /
server_provisioning do.
