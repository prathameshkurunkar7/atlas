"""The Satellite read API — the surface a Satellite orchestrator polls to register and
sync the VMs an Atlas provisions (spec/28, the provisioner/orchestrator split).

Atlas is a *pure provisioner*: it owns "a VM exists" and nothing about services. A
Satellite is a SEPARATE deployment that manages services itself, over its own SSH to
the hosts and guests Atlas hands over. It never reaches into Atlas's DB — it reads
these methods to mirror the VM/Server it needs and learns the connection details
(the host's public IPv4, the guest's public IPv6) so it can SSH in.

One Satellite federates many Atlasses, so a Satellite holds a per-Atlas credential and
base URL; each Atlas authenticates the caller with THIS Atlas's admin token (System
Manager), exactly like the Central inbound API (`central_link.py`). These are strictly
read-only: the write side of the boundary is Satellite SSHing the box, not calling here.
