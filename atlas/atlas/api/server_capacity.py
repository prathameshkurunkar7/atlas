"""Whitelisted helper used by the Virtual Machine creation form.

Returns "what does this Server have, and how much of it is already spoken for?"
so the operator can see oversubscription before clicking Provision. Capacity is
tracked on three axes — CPU, RAM, and pool disk — each reported as a
`{total, effective, used}` block. `effective is None` on an axis means the host
is *uncatalogued* on that axis (the agent hasn't reported a total, and for CPU
there is no slug either): the host reports unlimited capacity on that axis and
placement puts a VM there — the operator vouched for it by marking it Active.

CPU is oversubscribable: a VM's `cpu_max_cores` is a cgroup cpu.max bandwidth
cap, not a pinned core, so a host can safely back more vCPUs than it physically
has. The fleet-wide multiplier is `Atlas Settings.overprovision_factor`
(default 1 — no oversubscription until the operator raises it), applied to the
CPU axis only. RAM and disk are hard fits — a VM's memory/disk either fits or it
doesn't — so their effective budget is the raw total, no factor.

Host totals are agent-reported and stamped on `Server` (vcpus_total,
memory_megabytes_total, pool_disk_gigabytes_total). Until the agent ships them
these are unset → every axis uncatalogued → unlimited, which is exactly the
pre-three-resource behavior. For CPU there is also a legacy fallback: the static
slug→vCPU dict, so vCPU accounting keeps working on hosts catalogued the old way
before the agent reports.
