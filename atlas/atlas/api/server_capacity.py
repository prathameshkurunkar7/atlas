"""Whitelisted helper used by the Virtual Machine creation form.

Returns "what does this Server have, and how much of it is already spoken for?"
so the operator can see oversubscription before clicking Provision. vCPU totals
come from a small static dict keyed by DigitalOcean size slug — same maintenance
model as `Provider Size.monthly_cost_usd`.

Capacity is deliberately oversubscribable: a VM's `cpu_max_cores` is a cgroup
cpu.max bandwidth cap, not a pinned core, so a host can safely back more vCPUs
than it physically has. The fleet-wide multiplier is `Atlas Settings.overprovision_factor`
(default 1 — no oversubscription until the operator raises it). A size we don't
recognize has *no* known total, so we report unlimited capacity and let
placement put a VM there — the operator vouched for the host by marking it
Active (self-managed hosts have no slug at all).
