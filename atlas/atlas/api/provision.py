"""Central-facing provisioning — the operator entry point Central calls to lay
down a tenant VM.

Central owns end-users; it talks to Atlas as the operator (token auth as the
Central service user). It supplies *what* to run (the tenant it belongs to + the
size), never *where* — placement (server) and the base image are Atlas's concern.

WIRE SHAPE (unchanged) vs. WHAT'S BEHIND IT (changed): Central still calls
`create_vm` and mirrors a VM-shaped row — `name`, `ipv6_address`, `gateway_url`,
`login_url`, etc. But a *bench* VM (a baked-image tenant environment) is now owned
by a `Pilot` DocType, not the `Virtual Machine` itself: the bench provision (boot a
bench image, deploy in-guest, mint the one-click login URL) lives on the Pilot so
the Virtual Machine stays a pure microVM. So `create_vm` creates a **Pilot** (which
creates and owns the VM), and the bench fields in the mirror row — `gateway_url`
(`https://<subdomain>.<region domain>`) and, once Running, `login_url` + its expiry
— are read back THROUGH the Pilot. The plain VM facts (name, ipv6) are read through
the VM the Pilot created. Central sees the same VM-shaped payload as before.

This is the write half of the Central↔Atlas tenancy contract whose read half is
the Tenant DocType (resources stamped with the owning `team`). It returns the VM
in the exact shape Central's Asset mirror upserts, so Central can reflect the new
server immediately without waiting for a reconcile.

	"""What can this region provision right now? — Central's pre-create check.

	Central speaks in resources (CPU / RAM / disk), not Atlas size presets, and
	never sees hosts — placement is Atlas's concern. So this answers two things in
	resource terms:

	- `available`: can *some* Active host seat a minimal VM? Central shows
	  "Capacity not available" when False. Checked via `largest_vm` returning a
	  shape at all — an Active host exists with room.
	- `largest_vm`: the biggest single VM shape placeable right now —
	  `{vcpus, memory_megabytes, disk_gigabytes}` — the free headroom on the best
	  host (a VM lands on one host, so this is a real co-schedulable shape, not a
	  fleet sum). `null` when no Active host exists.

	`unmeasured` is True when the winning host has an axis the on-host agent hasn't
	reported yet: `largest_vm` then contains large sentinel values, not
	measurements, and Central should treat the shape as "effectively unlimited /
	size unknown" rather than a fact. It goes False once the agent stamps totals.

	`available` reuses placement's real gate (`default_server`) for the smallest
	provisionable VM, so the pre-check and the create-time gate can never disagree
	on logic, only on timing.

	Advisory: the authoritative gate is placement's NoCapacityError at create time
	(capacity can change between this call and the create). Runs with the Central
