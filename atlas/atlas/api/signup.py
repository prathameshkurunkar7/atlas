"""The public signup on-ramp (plan 04, Contract C).

The one guest-reachable write in Atlas: a visitor states an email + a subdomain,
we hold the intent as a `Site Request` (Pending), and email them a verification
link. **Nothing is provisioned here** — no User, no Site, no VM. That all waits
for the verification click (`atlas/www/verify.py` → `SiteRequest.verify`), which
is the gate against a typo'd or hostile address triggering billable compute.

This module is the form's submit endpoint + the verification email. It is
guest-writable, sends mail, and (downstream) provisions — i.e. an abuse surface —
so it is rate-limited per IP (decorator) AND caps outstanding unverified requests
per email (an attacker can't fan out a thousand Pending rows from one address).
