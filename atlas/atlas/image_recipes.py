"""Image recipe registry — the code-defined catalogue of buildable images.

Atlas builds an image by provisioning a plain Ubuntu VM, running a committed
`build.sh` inside it over guest-SSH, then snapshotting the result (the
build-in-guest + snapshot pattern, spec/08-images.md, spec/12-proxy.md). The two
images this exists for — the golden bench image and the reverse-proxy image —
differ only in *which committed tree* gets uploaded, the build-VM sizing, a
post-build finalize step, and what to do with the snapshot. An `ImageRecipe`
captures exactly those differences; everything else (upload, run detached, record
a Task, fail loud) is the shared `atlas.atlas.image_builder.run_build` seam.

This is a Python registry, NOT a DocType: a recipe points entirely at committed
files (`bench/`, `proxy/`) and pinned sizes, and `finalize` is a callback — a
data row could only ever mirror it. Adding an image type is a small reviewable
code change beside the committed tree it bakes, the same discipline the two
`build.sh` files' pinned versions already follow (spec taste: few dependencies,
pinned versions are a deliberate update).
