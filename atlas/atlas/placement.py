"""Default server + image for a Virtual Machine created without them.

A dashboard user (see spec/11-user-ui.md) never picks where their machine
runs — they state name, size, and SSH key, and the controller fills `server`
and `image` here. The operator still owns the fleet: which Servers are Active
and which Image is the default are operator decisions. This is placement, not
scheduling — first Active server with room, no balancing.

Operators creating a VM in Desk supply `server`/`image` explicitly, so this
never runs for them.
