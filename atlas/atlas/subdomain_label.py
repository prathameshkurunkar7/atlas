"""Contract-A subdomain rules, shared by `Site` and `Site Request`.

The one routing string (plan 00, spec/14-self-serve.md) starts as a single DNS
label the user picks. Two doctypes gate that label: `Site` (the real resource, at
insert) and `Site Request` (the pre-verification holding row, plan 04). They must
enforce the *same* rules — otherwise a request could reserve a name `Site` would
reject, or two requests pass and collide at fulfilment. Factor the rules here so
there is one source of truth.

These are the label-shape + reserved-name + availability checks only. `Site`
still owns the authoritative uniqueness at insert (its FQDN key); `availability`
here is a best-effort early check so a user learns "taken" at request time, not
after verifying.
