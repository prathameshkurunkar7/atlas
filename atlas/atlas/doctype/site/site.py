"""Site DocType — the user-facing "my Frappe site at acme.blr1.frappe.dev".

A `Site` is the user-owned aggregate that ties together the one routing identity
(Contract A), the backing Virtual Machine it clones from the golden bench
snapshot, and the readiness state (Contract B). It is NOT the `Subdomain` (the
proxy map, which it creates once it is serving) and NOT the `Virtual Machine`
(which it owns/creates). See spec/14-self-serve.md.

The lifecycle mirrors `Virtual Machine`: an `IMMUTABLE_AFTER_INSERT` tuple guarded
in `validate()`, a controller-written `status` Select (read-only on the form),
`after_insert()` enqueues the provision→deploy background job, and whitelisted
methods that `frappe.throw` early on the wrong state.
