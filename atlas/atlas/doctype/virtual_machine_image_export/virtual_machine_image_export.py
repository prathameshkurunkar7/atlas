"""Virtual Machine Image Export — the resumable phase row for a host-to-host copy
of a base image.

See spec/08-images.md § "Two origins for a base image" and spec/24-vm-migration.md
§5.1. A local (snapshot-promoted) base image has no rootfs URL, so `sync-image`
cannot place it on another server — it lives only on the host it was promoted on.
This row drives shipping that base LV to a target the same way a VM migration ships
a VM's local base as a sub-step: NBD export of the read-only base LV + a tar of the
image directory (the kernel), the target hydrates via dm-clone, collapses to a
read-only local LV, and gains an identical local `Virtual Machine Image` row.

The transport is the migration's proven one: **plain TCP, unencrypted, no SSH** —
`qemu-nbd` bound to the source's public IPv4, the target's `nbd-client` dials it
directly (spec/24 §2.1). The base LV is read-only and immutable, so this is a
one-shot cold copy with none of a live VM's cutover machinery.

The row is the source of truth for an in-flight export (spec principle 2): which
image, source/target servers, the current phase (`status`), the NBD handle, and
hydration progress. The scheduler re-enters the recorded `status` each tick, so the
row alone is enough to resume after a crash. The phase machine that ADVANCES a row
lives in atlas/atlas/export.py (the scheduler callback), exactly as migration.py
drives Virtual Machine Migration.
