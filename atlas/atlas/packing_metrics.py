"""Pure fleet-packing metrics — no Frappe, no simulator state.

Computed from a snapshot of per-host budgets + usage (the same per-axis numbers
`capacity_for_server` produces, and what `packing_sim` tracks). These are the
numbers `spec/28-placement.md` says to watch: committed utilisation, the
cell-compaction ratio, stranded capacity / axis imbalance, and sellable share-unit
slots. The simulator uses them to score a run; they also work standalone against any
list of objects exposing `.budget` (dict over `AXES`), `.used` (dict) and
`.vm_count` — e.g. a thin adapter over `capacity_for_server`.
