"""VM migration orchestration — the resumable phase machine and its callback.

See spec/19-vm-migration.md. This is the CONTROLLER-side driver; the host work
runs in the `migration-*` Task scripts (scripts/). Wired in hooks.py:

    scheduler_events = {"cron": {"*/2 * * * *": ["atlas.atlas.migration.reconcile_migrations"]}}

The design point: a migration is a sequence of idempotent host phases, each
recorded as the Migration row's `status`. Two things drive it: `start_migration`
(enqueued by VirtualMachine.migrate on insert) runs the phases back-to-back, each
completed phase chaining the next so there is no wait between them; the
`reconcile_migrations` cron re-drives the one holding phase (Hydrating) and is the
safety net — a dropped RQ job, a provider rate-limit, an SSH blip, or a worker
crash never strands a migration, because the cron re-enters the recorded phase and
every phase resumes from the DB, never from in-memory state.

**Stage 1 (this build): change-address only.** The VM keeps its UUID (and every
host-local value derived from it) but gets a NEW public IPv6 on the target, and
the proxy/Subdomain layer is re-pointed to it. The keep-address paths (Scaleway
range-move §2, DigitalOcean permanent-forward §2.9) are later stages.

**Transport (this build): plain TCP.** The source binds `qemu-nbd` to its public
IPv4 and the target's `nbd-client` dials it directly — no SSH tunnel yet (the
host-to-host credential is a deferred stage-3 prerequisite, spec/19 §2.1). This
data path is unencrypted; it is a deliberate get-it-working-first shortcut.

Every phase obeys two rules:
  1. It runs its host work INLINE via run_task (not frappe.enqueue) — run_task
     saves the Task row first and raises on failure, and inline execution can't
     be a "lost worker job".
  2. It is idempotent: it checks "am I already done?" (the resume key) before
     acting, so re-entering a half-finished phase is safe.
