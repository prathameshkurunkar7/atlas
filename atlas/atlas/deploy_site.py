"""Per-site deploy control plane — turn a booted golden bench VM into a serving
Frappe site, and the HTTP readiness gate that proves it (Contract B).

This is the controller side of the in-guest deploy (spec/14-self-serve.md), the
seam `atlas.atlas.doctype.site.site` imports (`deploy_site`, `wait_for_http`). It
is the sibling of `atlas.atlas.bench_image.build_bench`: drive an in-guest script
over the SAME SSH-to-the-guest path (`connection_for_guest`), recording the op as
a Task row. Where `build_bench` runs the heavy, per-site-INVARIANT bake
(bench-cli + `bench init` + a baked `site.local`, brought up + frozen serving),
this runs the ONE per-VM thing the golden image can't bake: the on-disk identity.
RENAME model (Contract A) — the baked `site.local` is renamed to the per-VM FQDN,
so the on-disk site name == the proxy Host header == the Site key. The production
gunicorn is multitenant (no `--site`), resolving the site from the request Host
per request, so the rename + a regenerated `server_name <fqdn>` vhost serve it
with NO restart. The owner is handed the SHARED baked Administrator password
(rotated after first login), so the deploy does NO `set-admin-password` — dropping
that ~28s CPU-throttled `bench frappe` boot is the main latency win.

Two functions, two execution sites (spec/14-self-serve.md "What runs where"):

- `deploy_site` drives `bench/deploy-site.py` IN THE GUEST over guest-SSH: it
  `bench rename-site`s the baked site to the FQDN (which regenerates the bench's
  nginx vhost — v6 listener included — and re-runs production setup, a fast no-op
  on a production-baked clone) — no password reset. The db root password is baked +
  shared; the admin password is the baked throwaway the owner rotates.
- `wait_for_http` runs ON THE CONTROLLER, polling the guest's public /128 :80
  until an HTTP 200 — the readiness signal that, and ONLY that, flips a Site to
  Running (Contract B). NOT the VM's `status == Running` (that means "jailer
  launched the microVM", not "Frappe is serving").
