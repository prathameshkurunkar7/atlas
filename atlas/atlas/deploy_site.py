"""Per-site deploy control plane — turn a booted golden bench VM into a serving
Frappe site, and the HTTP readiness gate that proves it (Contract B).

This is the controller side of the in-guest deploy (spec/14-self-serve.md), the
seam `atlas.atlas.doctype.site.site` imports (`deploy_site`, `wait_for_http`). It
is the sibling of `atlas.atlas.bench_image.build_bench`: drive an in-guest script
over the SAME SSH-to-the-guest path (`connection_for_guest`), recording the op as
a Task row. Where `build_bench` runs the heavy, per-site-INVARIANT bake
(bench-cli + `bench init` + a baked `site.local`), this runs the per-site work the
golden image can't bake because it carries the routing identity (Contract A):
RENAME the baked `site.local` to `<fqdn>` (a directory move, since a bench-cli
site's identity is its dir name) + reset the admin password + the production
bring-up so the bench's own nginx serves the site on :80.

Two functions, two execution sites (spec/14-self-serve.md "What runs where"):

- `deploy_site` drives `bench/deploy-site.py` IN THE GUEST over guest-SSH. It
  generates the per-site Administrator password (the db root password is
  baked + shared; the admin password is per-site, never baked) and returns it so
  the Site row can store it for the owner.
- `wait_for_http` runs ON THE CONTROLLER, polling the guest's public /128 :80
  until an HTTP 200 — the readiness signal that, and ONLY that, flips a Site to
  Running (Contract B). NOT the VM's `status == Running` (that means "jailer
  launched the microVM", not "Frappe is serving").
