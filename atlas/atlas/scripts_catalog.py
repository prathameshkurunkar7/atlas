"""Catalog of scripts that can be invoked as Tasks on a Server — the single
authority on a *verb* (a `Task.script` value like `provision-vm`).

A Task references a **verb**, not a filename: `Task.script = "provision-vm"`,
executed on the host as `atlas provision-vm --flags`. The on-disk file keeps its
extension (`provision-vm.py`, `reboot-server.sh`); only the Task identifier drops
it. This module is the seam that maps between the two:

  - `allowed_scripts()` lists every verb the SSH runner will execute on a host.
  - `operator_visible_scripts()` is the subset the desk's Run Task dialog exposes;
    anything that should only run from a VM/Image controller is excluded.
  - `file_for(verb)` → the basename on disk (`provision-vm.py`).
  - `kind(verb)` → `"python"` | `"shell"`, derived from that file's extension —
    the runner asks this instead of sniffing a `.py`/`.sh` suffix off `Task.script`.
  - `resolve(verb)` is the file-system lookup the runner uses; it searches both the
    production scripts directory and the e2e test-only directory, because e2e probe
    scripts (which never appear in the picker) need to be findable by verb too.
