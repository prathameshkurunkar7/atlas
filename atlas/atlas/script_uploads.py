"""Per-script sidecar uploads.

Every Python task imports the shared `atlas` package (lvm, paths, rootfs, _run,
_task, …). That package is DURABLE host state: `Server.bootstrap()` places it
once at `/var/lib/atlas/bin/atlas/` (see server.py). Tasks `import atlas` from
there — the runner sets `PYTHONPATH=/var/lib/atlas/bin` on the remote command
(see `_ssh/runner.py::_remote_command()`), so NO package files are re-staged per
Task. This trades per-Task package freshness for ~9 fewer SSH round-trips per
Task: a controller change to a lib module reaches a host on the next `bootstrap`,
the single refresh point (the same contract the systemd hooks already follow —
vm-network-up.py et al. run the durable copy too). See spec/04-tasks.md.

A few scripts still need extra sidecars (sync-image bakes the guest network unit
into the image it builds); those are staged per-Task via SCRIPT_SIDECARS.

Consumed by `_ssh/runner.py::_run_remote_script()` before each invocation.
Tuples are (local_relative_to_repo_root, remote_absolute).
