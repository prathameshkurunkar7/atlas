"""Golden bench image control plane — bake a bench-preinstalled image by building
INSIDE a plain guest over SSH, then snapshotting it.

This is the controller side of the golden bench image (spec/08-images.md), and the
direct sibling of `atlas.atlas.proxy.build_proxy`: provision a plain Ubuntu VM,
upload the committed `bench/` tree, run `build.sh` over the SAME SSH-to-the-guest
path the proxy build uses, then stop + snapshot the VM. That snapshot is the
reusable "golden bench image" — a VM with bench-cli, the uv venv, the Frappe
clone, MariaDB + Redis, AND a fully-created site baked under the fixed name
`site.local`, so `deploy-site.py` (spec/14-self-serve.md) only RENAMES that baked site to the
per-VM FQDN (a directory move) + resets its admin password, never paying the
multi-minute `bench new-site` per signup.

We deliberately do NOT chroot-bake the rootfs at image-sync time: apt's
MariaDB/Redis postinst expect a running init, which a bare chroot lacks. Building
in a real booted guest (the proxy precedent) sidesteps that entirely and reuses
the existing Virtual Machine Snapshot machinery for the rollable artifact.

Each guest op is recorded as a Task row (synthetic `bench-build` script) for the
operator's audit trail, exactly like the proxy guest ops.
