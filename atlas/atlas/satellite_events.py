"""Lifecycle webhooks to the Satellite orchestrator (spec/28, the provisioner/
orchestrator split).

Atlas is a pure provisioner — it never calls into a service. But a Satellite (a
SEPARATE deployment) needs to know when a VM comes and goes so it can register the
box and (de)apply its services. Atlas emits a thin, HMAC-signed webhook on the VM
lifecycle; the body carries only identity — which Atlas, which VM, what happened —
and the Satellite reads the full VM back through the read API (`api/satellite.py`).

Wired as `doc_events` observers, exactly like Central reporting (`central_report.py`),
so core stays oblivious to what the Satellite does with the event. Delivery is
best-effort and runs after commit, so a Satellite that is down never wedges a
provision; the Satellite's own reconcile sweep (`list_virtual_machines`) is the
backstop for a missed webhook.
