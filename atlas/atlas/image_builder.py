"""Image builder — the shared seam that builds an image INSIDE a guest over SSH.

`run_build(vm, recipe)` is the de-duplicated core of what `bench_image.build_bench`
and `proxy.build_proxy` both used to do verbatim: upload a committed source tree
into a freshly-provisioned guest, run its `build.sh` DETACHED (so a mid-build SSH
reset doesn't kill the long compile/bake), run the recipe's finalize step, and
record one Task row for the operator's audit trail — failing loud on a non-zero
exit. The two `build_*` functions are now thin wrappers that hand it a recipe.

The full provision→build→snapshot→register lifecycle around this seam lives in the
`Image Build` DocType (spec/15-image-builder.md); this module owns only the
upload+build+finalize+audit half. It SSHes *into the guest* (`connection_for_guest`,
the second SSH target type, spec/04), not onto a Server — the same path the proxy
control plane uses.
