"""The user-facing provisioning step view for a `Site` (spec/14-self-serve.md).

`Site.status` is the controller's coarse lifecycle state (Pending → Provisioning
→ Deploying → Running, or Failed). The status page the verified user lands on
wants something finer: the *six* steps `auto_provision` runs (the spec's step
table), each shown as done / running / pending / failed, so the user watches the
work happen instead of staring at one word.

This module is the single source of truth that turns a `status` into that step
list — shared by the page's first render (`site_status.py`) and the realtime
payload the controller pushes on every transition (`site.auto_provision`). One
function, no duplication: the page and the live update can never disagree.

The mapping is intentionally derived from `status` alone (not from a per-step
progress field on the Site) — the controller already owns `status` as the one
durable state, and the six steps are a fixed, ordered consequence of it. A step
is `done` if status is past its phase, `running` if status is at its phase, and
`pending` otherwise; on `Failed` the step that the current phase maps to is
marked `failed` and the rest stay pending.
