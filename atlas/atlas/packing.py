"""Pure placement/packing math — strategy scoring, no Frappe.

Shared by the live scorer (`atlas/atlas/placement.py`) and the offline simulator
(`atlas/atlas/packing_sim.py`) so the policy they reason about can't drift.
Everything here is plain numbers, never Server rows: a per-axis budget of `None`
means that axis is uncatalogued → unlimited (the operator vouched for the host by
Activating it).

The three packed axes are `cpu` (`cpu_max_cores` — the guaranteed share, which is
the packing dimension), `memory` (MB) and `disk` (GB). See `spec/28-placement.md`
for why the proportional size ladder makes packing one-dimensional, and why on
*homogeneous* hosts every strategy yields identical utilisation — the strategies
diverge only on heterogeneous fleets and on drainability/defragmentation, which the
simulator quantifies.
