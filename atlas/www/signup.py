"""`/signup` — the public on-ramp page (plan 04, Contract C).

The one guest-reachable form in Atlas: email + subdomain. It posts to
`atlas.atlas.api.signup.request_site` (a guest-allowed whitelisted method), which
holds the intent as a `Site Request` and emails a verification link. This page
only renders the form and the domain suffix so the user sees the FQDN they're
claiming (`acme.<domain>`); no site/VM work happens here (it waits for the
verification click — see `verify.py`).
