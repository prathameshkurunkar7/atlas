# Bring up one end of a VM migration's keep-address forward tunnel (spec/19 §2.9).
#
# When a VM migrates keeping its /128, the source host keeps holding the /64 the
# /128 is carved from — so it keeps receiving the VM's inbound traffic — and it
# forwards that traffic to the target over a per-VM point-to-point tunnel. This
# script brings up ONE end of that tunnel; the controller runs it on BOTH hosts
# in the TargetPreparing phase (source first as the listener, then target as the
# connector). The route installs that make traffic actually flow come later, at
# cutover (migration-source-forward.py / migration-target-receive.py).
#
# The tunnel is a `tun` device (one L3 family — the inner IPv6 /128) whose frames
# socat bridges to a plain TCP stream between the two hosts. STAGE transport is
# UNENCRYPTED plain TCP, matching the stage-1 NBD path (a secure host-to-host
# carrier is a deferred follow-up, spec/19 §2.1). The device name and TCP port
# are pure functions of the VM UUID, so both hosts derive them identically and a
# lost-task re-entry needs no stored state.
#
# Idempotent: an already-up tun device with a live socat is left alone; a
# re-entry re-asserts the address, MTU, and forwarding sysctl (all cheap no-ops
# if already set) and only (re)starts socat if it is not running.
#
# Inputs:
#   virtual_machine_name  - UUID (keys the device/port; also the tun-name)
#   role                  - "source" (TCP listener) or "target" (TCP connector)
#   tunnel_device         - the mig6-<vm8> interface name (controller-derived)
#   tunnel_port           - the localhost/peer TCP port for the socat carrier
#   source_host           - the source's reachable address (target role only;
#                           what the connector dials). Empty on the source.

	**TUN is address 1 (verified on the real hosts).** socat opens address 1
