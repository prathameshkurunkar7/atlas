# Rebuild/Restore a Stopped VM's disk from a source, keeping its identity
# (name, IPv6, MAC, tap, SSH key). The source is either one of the VM's own
# snapshots (Restore) or a base image's pristine rootfs (Rebuild). Either way
# the VM keeps its UUID, so step 2's freshly-derived host keys / machine-id /
# hostname match the VM the operator already knows.
#
# The caller guarantees the VM is Stopped (the unit is down, rootfs unmounted),
# so swapping the file underneath it is safe. firecracker.json, network.env and
# the systemd unit already exist from the original provision and are untouched.
# Idempotent: re-running replaces the rootfs again with the same source.
#
# Successor to rebuild-vm.sh. Same typed Task contract as snapshot-vm.py:
# RebuildInputs.from_args() parses the CLI flags that used to be env vars; there
# is no machine-readable result to emit (the controller only needs the exit
# code), so this prints a human "Rebuilt ..." line like the original.
