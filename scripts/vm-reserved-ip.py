# Attach or detach a Reserved IP's host-side 1:1-NAT to a RUNNING VM, with no
# reboot. The inbound mirror of NAT44 egress: the reserved v4 lands on the
# droplet (DO binds it via an anchor IP, not a routed prefix — so unlike the VM's
# public v6 it cannot be routed straight to the guest), and the host DNATs it in
# and SNATs the guest's egress out as the reserved IP. See spec/06-networking.md
# and lib/atlas/reserved_ip_nat.py for why NAT, not routing, is forced here.
#
# Two effects, both idempotent:
#   1. Mutate network.env (add/remove RESERVED_IPV4) so a later cold boot re-
#      creates the same NAT from disk via vm-network-up.py — the env is the
#      durable source of truth for the host networking, as for every other VM.
#   2. Apply/remove the live nft rules now, so an attach takes effect without
#      waiting for a restart.
#
# Unlike vm-network-up/down (systemd %i, positional arg), this is a Task: it
# takes typed --flags parsed by ReservedIpInputs.from_args(), dispatched by
# Reserved IP.attach()/detach(). It imports the per-task staged atlas package
# under /tmp/atlas/lib, like the other Task scripts.
