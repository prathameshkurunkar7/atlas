#     ssh/bench/login ever running first); reboot-safe on a live site VM.
#   * DefaultDependencies=no — opt out of the implicit After=sysinit.target that
#     would otherwise push it PAST sysinit (and thus past network/ssh).
#   * Deliberately NO `Before=sysinit.target` — that is exactly what makes
#     systemd-modules-load gate ssh; omitting it means sysinit does NOT wait on us,
#     so zfs.ko loads concurrently with sysinit/basic/network instead of before them.
#   * Before=zfs-import.target — still ordered AHEAD of the pool import / any mount
#     consumer, so the module is guaranteed present before bench-cli imports the pool.
# Net: zfs.ko is present before anything mounts the pool, but its insertion no
# longer sits on the single serial path that gates time-to-SSH.

# (`/lib/udev/rules.d/90-zfs.rules`: `KERNEL=="zfs", MODE="0666"`) whose ONLY job
# for a dataset-only pool is to relax the /dev/zfs node from its kernel-default
# 0600 root:root so NON-ROOT `zfs`/`zpool` queries work. bench-cli's build runs
# some `zfs get` calls as the unprivileged `frappe` user, which then fail with
# "the ZFS utilities must be run as root" if /dev/zfs stays 0600. We mask
# systemd-udevd (fixed virtio topology needs no rule-based device mgmt), so that
# udev rule never runs — we reproduce its one effect here, tied exactly to when
