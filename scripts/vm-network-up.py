#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Host-side network for a VM. Invoked by ExecStartPre in the systemd unit
# (must run before the jailer's ExecStart so the namespace + tap exist when the
# jailer joins the netns and Firecracker opens the tap). Reads
# /var/lib/atlas/virtual-machines/$1/network.env. Idempotent.
#
# Approach: each VM gets its OWN network namespace so a jail breakout cannot see
# the host's interfaces, the uplink, or other VMs' taps. The VM's tap lives
# inside that namespace; a veth pair bridges the namespace back to the host.
#
# The server has DigitalOcean's /64 prefix routed to it, but only a /124 is
# *usable* (DO routes the /64 to the droplet; the rest has no route inside DO's
# fabric). So we hand out addresses inside a fixed /124 and use proxy-NDP on the
# uplink to make the upstream router believe each VM address is on-link. The
# guest still uses fe80::1 (on the tap, inside its namespace) as its gateway;
# the only change from the host-netns model is one extra link-local hop across
# the veth, fully inside the host.
#
# systemd-invoked, NOT a Task: it takes a single positional argument (the VM
# UUID), not --flags, because the unit's ExecStartPre passes `%i`. It imports the
# DURABLE atlas package under /var/lib/atlas/bin (placed by bootstrap), not the
# per-task staged copy.

	#    - A routed flexible IP (Self-Managed / Scaleway Elastic Metal) arrives at
	#      the host destined to the reserved IP itself: DNAT it directly, no anchor.
