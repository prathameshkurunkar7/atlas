"""The one place that touches the host — the zx slice the spec promised.

`bash -x; set -euo pipefail` gave us, for free: echo-every-command tracing into
the Task log, and abort-on-first-failure. Python gives us neither by default, so
we reimplement that small slice here (spec principle 6: don't import — copy).
This is ~one screen of code and it is the *only* module in the package that runs
a subprocess; everything else is pure functions over strings, so everything else
is unit-testable without a host.

Patterned on references/agent/agent/base.py::execute — a subprocess wrapper that
streams output and raises on non-zero — reduced to the slice Atlas needs.
