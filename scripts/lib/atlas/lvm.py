"""LVM thin-pool, object-oriented — the successor to scripts/lib/lvm.sh.

Every per-VM disk is a thin LV that is a CoW snapshot of a read-only base image
LV; the pool sits on a PV. On a stock cloud droplet with no spare disk the PV is
a loopback file (a sparse backing file on the root fs); on bare metal with real
NVMe (Scaleway Elastic Metal) the PV is the NVMe device(s) themselves — the
backing is chosen by `PoolBacking` (see below). The two objects here are the only
place that knows the pool layout.

- `LogicalVolume` is one LV. It knows its own name and device path, whether it
  exists, how to activate, snapshot, and remove itself. Naming is derived, never
  stored (mirrors networking.py's derive_*): a VM disk is atlas-vm-<uuid>, a
  snapshot atlas-snap-<uuid>, a base image atlas-image-<name>.
- `ThinPool` is the VG + thin pool. It mints LVs by role (`vm_disk`, `snapshot`,
  `base_image`, `from_device`) and answers pool-fullness.

Public methods are the verbs an operator-level task calls (`snapshot`, `remove`,
`activate`). Private methods (leading underscore) are the raw `lvchange` /
`udevadm` / `lsblk` pokes — the host surface that e2e exercises. The pure parsing
that bit us on real hosts (lsblk MAJ:MIN padding, the data_percent decimal) is
isolated in @staticmethods so it is unit-testable with no LVM stack at all.

	  `_MIN_POOL_DISK_BYTES`. This is a box's genuine spare NVMe drive (the OS
