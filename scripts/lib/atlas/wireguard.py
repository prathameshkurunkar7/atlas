"""Host-side WireGuard tunnel plumbing for the VPN broker (spec/19-vpn-broker.md).

Each tunnel terminates on the host with its **own** wg interface in the host root
netns, listening on a per-tunnel UDP port on the server's public address. The
interface routes a decrypted packet destined to the VM's `/128` into that VM's
namespace over the host route `vm-network-up.py` already laid down — so reaching
the VM needs no new routing. A point-to-point `/127` overlay on the interface
gives the host and client ends private v6 addresses, and its connected route is
the VM's return path to the client.

**Isolation** — the one thing that makes "only your VM" true — is interface-keyed
nft rules (the interface name is 1:1 with the tunnel), split across two hooks
because the kernel routes *transit* and *host-local* traffic on different paths.

*Transit* — a decrypted packet the host would route onward — is the `forward`
chain. Two rules in the existing `inet atlas forward`:

    iifname <iface> ip6 daddr <vm-v6> accept
    iifname <iface> drop

WireGuard's cryptokey routing only governs what the host sends *back* to a peer;
it does not restrict the *destination* of a decrypted inbound packet, so without
the `drop` a client could address another VM and the host would route it. The
`drop` closes that — anything from this interface bound for another VM or the
internet is dropped. These two rules must sit at the **head** of the forward
chain, above the broad per-VM forward-accept rules vm-network-up.py lays down
(`ip6 daddr <vm> oifname <veth> accept`). Those rules do not constrain the input
interface, so an appended tunnel `drop` is shadowed: a packet from this tunnel to
*another* VM matches that VM's accept first (accept is terminal) and is forwarded
— the exact leak the drop exists to stop. So we `insert` the pair (drop first,
then accept, leaving [accept, drop, …per-VM…]) instead of appending it.

*Host-local* — a packet a client addresses to the **host itself** — never reaches
the forward hook: local delivery is the `input` path. So the forward `drop` does
NOT cover the host, and a client could craft `dst=<overlay host end>` (it shares
the /127) or any host address with a service bound to `::` (sshd, the Frappe
stack) and reach it. A third, symmetric rule in a dedicated `inet atlas input`
chain (`policy accept`, so non-tunnel host ingress — including the tunnel's OWN
outer UDP listener, which lands on the physical uplink, not `wg-…` — is untouched)
closes that:

    iifname <iface> drop

Nothing legitimately terminates on the host over the tunnel (the host overlay end
exists only to route the VM's return traffic), so a blanket input drop is safe.

Everything here is pure string/argv construction except `apply_tunnel` /
`remove_tunnel` / `apply_persisted_tunnels`, which touch the host. The rule and
command *generation*, and the `TunnelConfig` (de)serialization, are unit-testable
with bare `python3 -m unittest` (no host), like `reserved_ip_nat`.
