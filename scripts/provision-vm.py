# Provision one Firecracker VM on this server. Single task: prepares disk,
# config, networking, then starts the systemd unit. Run once per VM.
#
# Successor to provision-vm.sh, the biggest task. Same typed Task contract as
# snapshot-vm.py / rebuild-vm.py: ProvisionInputs.from_args() parses the CLI
# flags that used to be env vars; there is no machine-readable result to emit
# (the controller only needs the exit code), so this prints a human
# "Provisioned ..." line like the original.
#
# Inputs (formerly environment variables, now --kebab-case CLI flags):
#   virtual_machine_name  - UUID, used for directory, tap, systemd instance
#   image_name            - directory under /var/lib/atlas/images
#   kernel_filename       - filename inside the image directory
#   rootfs_filename       - filename inside the image directory
#   vcpus                 - integer
#   memory_mb             - integer
#   disk_gb               - integer, final rootfs size for this VM
#   mac_address           - e.g. 06:00:01:02:03:04
#   tap_device            - e.g. atlas-<first 9 hex of vm name>
#   virtual_machine_ipv6  - the VM's address inside the server's /124
#   ipv4_host_cidr        - host side of the per-VM NAT44 /30, e.g. 100.64.0.9/30
#   ipv4_guest_cidr       - guest side of the same /30, e.g. 100.64.0.10/30
#   ipv4_gateway          - host side address (no mask), the guest's v4 gateway
#   ssh_public_key        - injected into the rootfs
#   atlas_fc_uid          - per-VM uid the jailer drops Firecracker to (gid == uid)
#   atlas_netns           - per-VM network namespace name
#   host_veth             - host-side veth interface name
#   namespace_veth        - namespace-side veth interface name
#   cgroup_arg (repeatable)   - one cgroup VALUE per flag, e.g.
#                               --cgroup-arg memory.max=… --cgroup-arg "cpu.max=Q P".
#                               The launcher prefixes each with --cgroup (see NOTE).
#   resource_arg (repeatable) - one resource-limit VALUE per flag; the launcher
#                               prefixes each with --resource-limit.
#   snapshot_rootfs_path  - optional; a snapshot's /dev/atlas/<name> device path
#                           (clone path); empty for a base-image provision
