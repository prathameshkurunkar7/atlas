# Host-side network for a VM. Invoked by ExecStartPost in the systemd unit.
# Reads /var/lib/atlas/virtual-machines/$1/network.env. Idempotent.
#
# Approach: the server has DigitalOcean's /64 prefix routed to it, but only a
# /124 is *usable* for routing onward (DO routes the /64 to the droplet, and
# the rest of the /64 has no route inside DO's fabric). So we hand out
# addresses inside a fixed /124 carved from the /64, and we use proxy-NDP on
# the uplink to make the upstream router believe each VM address is on-link.
# The host side of every tap gets fe80::1 link-local so the guest can use
# fe80::1 as its default gateway without us needing to assign a routable
# address to the tap.
