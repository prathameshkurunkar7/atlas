# Source side of a VM migration (spec/19), LOCAL-BASE-IMAGE ship: export the VM's
# read-only base image LV over NBD so the target can hydrate a copy of it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: a base image that was promoted from a snapshot (`is_local`) has
# no rootfs URL, so `sync-image` cannot place it on the target — it lives only on
# the host it was promoted on (spec/08-images.md). A VM on such an image could not
# migrate: `migration-clone-target` pre-flight fails with "base image LV not on
# target". This ships the local base the same way the disk itself is shipped — an
# NBD export the target flattens into a fresh local LV (spec/19 §5) — so the target
# gains the base LV + kernel it needs at cutover.
#
# The base LV is READ-ONLY and immutable, so — unlike the VM disk — we export it
# DIRECTLY, with no thin snapshot in between.
#
# TWO exports, so the target gains BOTH artifacts a base image needs (the rootfs
# LV *and* the on-disk image directory that holds the kernel), over the single
# plain-TCP NBD channel — no host-to-host SSH (deferred, §2.1) and no new HTTP
# surface:
#   - port nbd_port+2: the base rootfs LV (block device).
#   - port nbd_port+3: a FILE-backed export of a tar of the image directory
#     (kernel + rootfs sentinel). qemu-nbd can serve a plain file, so the small
#     metadata tar rides the same channel with no extra LV to create or clean up.
# (root disk = nbd_port, data disk = nbd_port+1, so +2/+3 never collide with the
# disk export already running for the same migration.)
#
# STAGE 1 transport: plain TCP, qemu-nbd bound to the source's PUBLIC IPv4 — same
# UNENCRYPTED get-it-working-first path as migration-export-source (§2.1).
#
# Idempotent: re-running returns the pids of already-serving qemu-nbd processes and
# re-uses the staged tar.
#
# Inputs:
#   image_name    - base image name; the LV is atlas-image-<image_name>
#   nbd_port      - the migration's base NBD port (controller passes disk port + 2;
#                   the image-dir tar is served on nbd_port + 1, i.e. disk_port + 3)
#   bind_address  - address qemu-nbd binds (the source's public IPv4)
#
# Emits ATLAS_RESULT={"nbd_port": N, "nbd_pid": P, "base_size_bytes": B,
#                     "meta_port": N+1, "meta_pid": P2, "meta_size_bytes": B2}
