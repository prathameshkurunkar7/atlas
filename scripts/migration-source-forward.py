# Source side of a keep-address migration's cutover (spec/19 §2.2, §2.9.2): point
# the VM's /128 delivery at the forward tunnel instead of its now-torn-down veth.
#
# By the time this runs, the source VM's unit is disabled and its ExecStopPost
# (vm-network-down.py) has already deleted this VM's netns/veth/tap AND its
# `<vmv6>/128 via fe80::3 dev <host_veth>` route — and, on a proxy-NDP provider,
# its proxy-NDP entry. But the source host still holds the /64, so inbound for the
# /128 still lands here. This re-establishes reachability onto the tunnel:
#
#   ip -6 route replace <vmv6>/128 dev <tunnel>     (atomic; no black hole)
#   nft ... daddr <vmv6> oifname <tunnel> accept     (forward inbound to the tunnel)
#   nft ... saddr <vmv6> iifname <tunnel> accept     (admit the reply coming back)
#
# On a proxy-NDP provider (DigitalOcean, forward_address=1) it ALSO re-asserts the
# proxy-NDP entry the unit stop just removed, so DO's edge keeps delivering the
# /128 here. On a routed-prefix provider (Scaleway) proxy-NDP is a no-op, so it is
# skipped — the routed /64 already delivers the /128 to this host.
#
# This is the point the forward becomes live and PERMANENT: nothing tears it down
# automatically (spec/19 §2.9.4). The operator collapses it by hand later
# (migration-forward-down.py via the Collapse-forward action).
#
# Idempotent: `ip route replace` and duplicate-guarded nft adds re-assert cleanly.
#
# Inputs:
#   virtual_machine_name  - UUID (for logging / symmetry)
#   virtual_machine_ipv6  - the /128 being forwarded (unchanged across the move)
#   tunnel_device         - the mig6-<vm8> interface (already up from forward-up)
#   reassert_proxy_ndp    - "1" on a proxy-NDP provider (DO), "0" on Scaleway
