# Target side of a keep-address migration's cutover (spec/19 §2.3, §2.9.3): the
# return-route policy that forces the guest's replies back UP the tunnel.
#
# The target runs its normal vm-network-up.py at unit start (same netns/veth/tap,
# the same `<vmv6>/128 via fe80::3 dev <host_veth>` route). Inbound therefore
# already flows source -> tunnel -> target veth -> guest once the source-forward
# is installed. The problem is EGRESS: the target sourcing the VM's /128 (which
# belongs to the SOURCE's /64) is dropped at the switch (spec/19 §2.0, verified on
# Scaleway). So the guest's replies must go back up the tunnel and egress at the
# source, which legitimately owns the /64.
#
# This installs a per-VM policy route to do exactly that:
#
#   ip -6 rule add from <vmv6> lookup <table> priority 100
#   ip -6 route replace default dev <tunnel> table <table>
#
# so a packet SOURCED FROM the VM's /128 is steered to a private table whose only
# route sends it out the tunnel. Everything else on the host is unaffected. This
# runs BEFORE migration-source-forward so the return path exists before inbound
# starts arriving.
#
# Idempotent: `ip -6 rule add` is guarded against a duplicate (rules stack, unlike
# `route replace`), and the table's default route is a `replace`.
#
# Inputs:
#   virtual_machine_name  - UUID (for logging / symmetry)
#   virtual_machine_ipv6  - the /128 whose egress is policy-routed
#   tunnel_device         - the mig6-<vm8> interface (already up from forward-up)
#   route_table           - the per-VM table id (controller-derived)
