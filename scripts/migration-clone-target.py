# Target side of a VM migration (spec/19), PREPARE phase: pre-flight the migration
# deps, create fresh local thin LV(s), connect an nbd client to the source's NBD
# export over plain TCP (stage 1 — no SSH tunnel yet, §2.1), and build the dm-clone
# device(s). The target VM's disk then reads-through to the source over NBD while
# `migration-poll-hydration` copies every block locally in the background.
#
# The identity inject + unit launch are NOT here: they run at cutover, once the
# dm-clone is collapsed, by re-using provision-vm (with preserve_host_keys=1). This
# script only lays the read-through disk down.
#
# SAMPLE dm-clone primer: `dmsetup create <name> --table "0 <sectors> clone <meta>
# <dest> <source> <region_sectors>"` serves reads from <source> (the NBD-backed
# source snapshot) until a region is hydrated, lands all writes on <dest> (the local
# thin LV), and — once `enable_hydration` is messaged — copies every region in the
# background. At 100% it can be collapsed (dmsetup remove), leaving the plain LV.
#
# Idempotent: every step checks its artifact before acting.
#
# Inputs:
#   virtual_machine_name  - UUID
#   image_name            - base image (kernel presence pre-flight)
#   disk_gb               - root disk size (>= source)
#   data_disk_gb          - data disk size, 0 if none
#   source_host           - source server public IPv4 (plain-TCP NBD target)
#   nbd_port              - source NBD port (data disk served on nbd_port+1)
#   nbd_base_slot         - first of this VM's contiguous nbd CLIENT devices on the
#                           target (root = base+0, data = base+1). Per-VM so two
#                           migrations to one target never share an nbd device.

	- SIZE: a stale/wrong connection (a prior migration's leftover) has the wrong
	  size, and a dm-clone whose source is smaller than the dest fails deep in
	  dmsetup. `expected_bytes=0` skips this check (caller doesn't know the size).
