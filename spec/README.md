# Atlas — Specification

Atlas is a Frappe app for managing Firecracker virtual machines on servers.
It is the lowest layer of a Frappe hosting platform. Sites, benches, IAM, and
billing live in separate apps on top.

The spec describes the system as it is. When the spec and code disagree, the
code is the source of truth and the spec gets updated to match, unless the
disagreement reveals a code defect. The `plan/drift.md` running log of these
discoveries is preserved as project history.

## Goals

- Track servers (the hosts that run Firecracker).
- Track virtual machines that run on those servers.
- Bootstrap a fresh server so it can host virtual machines.
- Provision, start, stop, and delete Ubuntu 24.04 Firecracker virtual machines.
- Drive everything from Atlas over SSH; record every task.
- Give each virtual machine a public IPv6 address.

## Non-goals (this iteration)

- No sites, benches, apps, databases, or workloads.
- No users, teams, roles, billing, quotas.
- No CLI. We will build one later on top of the same Frappe APIs.
- No private networking, no overlay, no IPv4 to the guest.
- No jailer, no unprivileged user, no SELinux or AppArmor. Root everywhere.
- No image build pipeline. We download Firecracker CI images and use them.
- No snapshots, live migration, or high availability.
- No autoscaling, scheduling, or placement. The operator picks the server.
- No metrics or alerting. `journalctl` is enough.
- No web UI of our own. Desk is the UI.

## Operating principles

1. **Desk is the UI.** Every operation is a DocType, a button on a DocType, or
   a server method on a DocType. No custom pages.
2. **The Frappe site is the source of truth.** A server is a cache; we can
   rebuild its on-disk state from the Frappe database. We do not scrape state
   back from the server.
3. **One task, one shell script.** Atlas uploads a shell script to a server
   over SSH and runs it. The script is the unit of work. We do not chain
   per-step SSH calls. See [04-tasks.md](./04-tasks.md).
4. **One virtual machine per server slot.** The operator picks the server
   when provisioning. No scheduler.
5. **Few dependencies.** Frappe + standard library + the system `ssh` command.
   On the server: `firecracker`, `systemd`, `iproute2`, `nftables`, `curl`,
   `jq`, `e2fsprogs`, `squashfs-tools`. No agent runs on the server.
6. **Don't import — copy.** If a third-party library has a good idea (pyinfra,
   zx), reimplement the small subset we need. We avoid library coupling on a
   foundational layer.
7. **Names are full words.** `Server`, `Task`, `Virtual Machine`,
   `Virtual Machine Image`, `Server Provider`. No `VM`, `Cmd`, or `Metal Node`.
