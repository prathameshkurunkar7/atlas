# Virtual machine lifecycle

The core lifecycle is **provision, start, stop, terminate**. On top of it sit
the disk- and state-management operations: **snapshot, restore/rebuild, clone,
resize, pause/resume**. Each operation is exactly one Task running one
idempotent shell script.

Two design rules keep this set small and safe:

- **Snapshots are disk-only.** A snapshot is a copy of the VM's
  `rootfs.ext4` — not a Firecracker memory-state snapshot. We never call
  Firecracker's `/snapshot/create` or `/snapshot/load`. This dodges the
  pre-boot-only load path (which can't coexist with our `--config-file`
  boot), the RAM-sized memory file, and the duplicate-identity hazard the
  [Firecracker docs](../../references/firecracker/docs/snapshotting/snapshot-support.md)
  call insecure. The boot path and the systemd unit are unchanged.
- **Disk operations require the VM to be Stopped.** Copying or replacing a
  mounted ext4 risks a torn filesystem; a cleanly unmounted rootfs is
  consistent. Firecracker also can't change vCPU/RAM on a running VM
  (`/machine-config` is pre-boot only), so resize is stop-required too. The
  desk surfaces these actions only while Stopped; the controllers enforce
  it.

The only operation that touches Firecracker's API socket is **pause/resume**
(`PATCH /vm {Paused|Resumed}`) — a runtime vCPU freeze that keeps RAM
resident, distinct from Stop.

## Identity

A `Virtual Machine.name` is a **UUID** assigned at insert. It never changes —
including on terminate. This means:

- The on-host directory path
  (`/var/lib/atlas/virtual-machines/<uuid>/`) is stable forever.
- The systemd unit instance name (`firecracker-vm@<uuid>.service`) is stable.
- Tasks referencing the VM stay valid after terminate.
- The operator does not have to invent a name; they use `title` for a
  human-readable label (the framework's `title_field`).

The MAC and TAP device are derived from the UUID so they are also stable.

## States

```
                  (insert via Create form — Save)
                              |
                              v
                          Pending ----(provision fails)----> Failed
                              |                                 |
                  (auto_provision worker)            (Provision retry)
                              |                                 |
                              v                                 |
                          Running <----------------------------+
                          ^   |  ^
                  (Resume)|   |  |(Start)
                          |   |  |
                       Paused |  Stopped
                          ^   |   ^  |
                   (Pause)|   +---+  |  (Snapshot / Rebuild / Restore / Resize
                          |  (Stop)  |   all stay Stopped)
                          +----------+

       (Terminate from any non-Terminated state) ---> Terminated
```

Statuses: `Pending`, `Running`, `Paused`, `Stopped`, `Failed`, `Terminated`.

Status checks treat this as an **open set** — controllers guard on the
specific states a transition allows, never "anything but X". `stop()` accepts
`Running` *or* `Paused`; `pause()` only `Running`; `resume()` only `Paused`;
`start()` only `Stopped`; `restart()` only `Running`/`Stopped` (a Paused VM
resumes or stops first). The disk operations (snapshot, rebuild, restore,
resize) require `Stopped`.

There is no transient `Provisioning` status — the Task row is the "in-flight"
record; the VM row only moves to `Running` after a successful Provision Task,
and stays at `Pending` if it fails (re-clickable because the script is
idempotent).

`Paused` keeps the microVM's RAM resident with vCPUs frozen; the systemd unit
is still active. It is reached only from `Running` and leaves to `Running`
(resume) or `Stopped` (stop = full shutdown).

`Terminated` is terminal. The doc stays in the table forever for history;
terminating a VM also deletes its snapshot rows (their on-host files went with
the VM directory).

## Provision

Trigger: operator fills the Create form (server, image, vCPUs, RAM,
disk, SSH key, title) and clicks `Save`. `Virtual Machine.after_insert`
enqueues `auto_provision` on the `long` queue; the worker calls
`Virtual Machine.provision()` on the freshly inserted row. There is no
operator-facing `Provision` primary on a `Pending` form — saving *is*
the provision trigger. The `Provision` primary returns on `Failed` as
a manual retry path.

Steps in Python (one DocType method, `Virtual Machine.provision`):

1. **Allocate networking values** in the Frappe DB:
   - `ipv6_address`: next free address in `Server.ipv6_virtual_machine_range`.
     The allocator selects `Server` for update, scans existing
     `Virtual Machine.ipv6_address` for that server, picks the next, commits.
   - `mac_address`: `06:00:` + first 4 bytes of the UUID, hex-formatted.
   - `tap_device`: `atlas-` + first 9 chars of the UUID with `-` removed.
     Linux `IFNAMSIZ` is 16 *bytes* including the null terminator, so the
     usable interface-name length is 15: `atlas-` (6) + 9 = 15 exactly.

2. **Run the provisioning task**:
   `run_task(server=name, script="provision-vm.sh", variables=…,
   virtual_machine=name)`. The script's step 0 verifies the image is on the
   server; if not, it exits non-zero with a clear error pointing the operator
   at the **Sync to Server** action. Provision does not auto-sync — image
   sync is a multi-minute operation and we want it deliberate, predictable,
   and visible as its own Task. The remaining steps (rootfs copy, resize,
   SSH key injection, per-VM hostname `atlas-<first-8-of-uuid>` written to
   `/etc/hostname` and `/etc/hosts`, 512 MiB `/swapfile`, fresh per-VM
   `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*` keypairs, per-VM `/etc/machine-id`, config
   write, systemd enable+start) happen inside the same SSH session.
   The per-VM identity writes share the rootfs mount with the SSH-key
   injection — no per-VM systemd unit needed. See
   [`atlas/scripts/provision-vm.sh`](../scripts/provision-vm.sh).

3. **Update status**: on Task success, `status = Running`,
   `last_started = now()`.

One Task per VM creation. (The image sync, if needed, is a separate Task
triggered explicitly by the operator before provisioning.)

### Host-side precondition

Before the guest-side probe runs, the e2e suite asserts the Atlas
host carries the SSH key on disk as
[07-filesystem-layout.md § SSH keys](./07-filesystem-layout.md)
describes: `Atlas Settings.ssh_private_key_path` resolves to a regular
file with mode `0600` (or `0400`, equally safe). This is a Python-side
check in
[`use_cases/virtual_machine_provisioning.py::_assert_provider_ssh_key_path`](../atlas/tests/e2e/use_cases/virtual_machine_provisioning.py),
not a bash probe — the file lives on the Atlas host, not in the guest.
A missing or wrong-mode key surfaces here as a clean AssertionError
rather than as a noisy SSH timeout in the guest probe.

### Guest-side identity contract

A freshly provisioned VM presents the following to an operator who SSHes
in. These are the contract `provision-vm.sh` writes and the e2e suite
([`phase5-guest-identity.sh`](../atlas/tests/e2e/scripts/phase5-guest-identity.sh))
asserts on every run:

- `hostname` is `atlas-<first-8-of-uuid>`. Same string in `/etc/hostname`
  and as a `127.0.1.1` entry in `/etc/hosts`.
- `/etc/machine-id` is unique per VM (derived from the UUID; the leaked
  CI value `4833ad8775a24dcc9d4b159af4e84d08` is gone).
- `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*` keypairs are unique per VM — generated on the
  host at provision time with `ssh-keygen` and written into the mounted
  rootfs. The CI build-container comment `root@bf0feaa40806` does not
  appear.
- The only global IPv4 on `eth0` is the Atlas NAT44 egress address
  (`100.64.x.x/30`, see [06-networking.md](./06-networking.md)). The
  `fcnet.service` that derived a phantom `91.83.x.x/30` from the MAC is
  removed at image-sync time, so any *non-`100.64`* global v4 is a
  regression. (The egress address and its reachability are asserted
  separately by the `phase5-ipv4-egress.sh` probe.)
- `/etc/hosts` has no Docker bridge leftover; just localhost, the
  per-VM 127.0.1.1 line, and the ip6-* aliases.
- Root password locked (`root:!:` in `/etc/shadow`). `sshd -T` reports
  `passwordauthentication no` — key-only by contract.
- `/swapfile` is active swap (512 MiB by default), referenced by the
  `/etc/fstab` installed at image-sync time.

This list is short for a reason: it is the operator-visible delta
between a stock Ubuntu cloud image and a VM that looks like the
operator's own. When the upstream image changes, every bullet either
stays a no-op (good) or needs a new strip (a regression to fix in
`sync-image.sh`).

## Start / Stop / Restart

Each is a single Task running a one-line script:

- `start-vm.sh`: `systemctl start firecracker-vm@<name>.service`
- `stop-vm.sh`: `systemctl stop firecracker-vm@<name>.service`
- `terminate-vm.sh`: see below

Restart is `stop-vm.sh` then `start-vm.sh`, but as the Python method's
choice — we do not add a `restart-vm.sh`, because the only thing `systemctl
restart` adds is one fewer network round-trip and we already paid for both.

Status updates happen after the Task succeeds. We do not poll the server
to verify; the source of truth is the Task. If the operator wants ground
truth, they click `Run Task` with `script=systemctl status ...`.

## Pause / Resume

The only operations that talk to Firecracker's API socket. Each is one Task
running a one-line `curl`:

- `pause-vm.sh`: `PATCH /vm {"state":"Paused"}` over
  `/var/lib/atlas/run/<uuid>.sock`. `Running` → `Paused`.
- `resume-vm.sh`: `PATCH /vm {"state":"Resumed"}`. `Paused` → `Running`.

`curl --fail` so a refused state change surfaces as a failed Task rather than
a silent success. Idempotent: Firecracker accepts a redundant Pause/Resume.
RAM stays resident across a pause — this is *not* a shutdown. The boot path is
still `--config-file`; the socket is created by the unit (`ExecStart
--api-sock`) and used only for these post-boot operations.

## Snapshot

`Virtual Machine.snapshot(title)` on a **Stopped** VM. Runs
[`snapshot-vm.sh`](../scripts/snapshot-vm.sh):

1. Pre-flight `df` check — refuse if free space on `/var/lib/atlas` can't hold
   the rootfs copy plus 10% headroom. The
   [Firecracker docs](../../references/firecracker/docs/snapshotting/snapshot-support.md)
   warn that unbounded snapshots are a DoS vector; this is the floor (no quota
   system this iteration).
2. `cp` the VM's `rootfs.ext4` to
   `/var/lib/atlas/virtual-machines/<uuid>/snapshots/<snapshot-uuid>/rootfs.ext4`.
3. Print `SIZE_BYTES=<n>`.

The controller inserts a `Virtual Machine Snapshot` row (`Pending`), runs the
Task, then records `rootfs_path`, `size_bytes`, and flips it to `Available`.
One snapshot = one row = one on-host file. Deleting the row runs
[`delete-snapshot-vm.sh`](../scripts/delete-snapshot-vm.sh) via `on_trash`
(skipped when the VM is already Terminated — its files are gone). See
[02-doctypes.md § Virtual Machine Snapshot](./02-doctypes.md#virtual-machine-snapshot).

## Restore / Rebuild

One controller method, `Virtual Machine.rebuild(source_type, source)`, on a
**Stopped** VM. It replaces the VM's `rootfs.ext4` while keeping its identity
(name/UUID, IPv6, MAC, tap, SSH key). Two sources:

- `source_type="snapshot"` — **Restore**: roll the disk back to one of this
  VM's own snapshots. `source` is the snapshot row name; it must belong to
  this VM and be `Available`. (The Snapshot form's **Restore to VM** button
  calls the thin wrapper `Snapshot.restore_to_vm()`.)
- `source_type="image"` — **Rebuild**: lay down a fresh disk from a base image
  (wipes stored data). `source` defaults to the VM's current image.

Both run [`rebuild-vm.sh`](../scripts/rebuild-vm.sh): remove the old rootfs,
copy from the source, resize to the VM's disk size, then re-inject this VM's
identity (SSH key, network env, hostname, swap, fresh host keys, machine-id)
via the shared `prepare-rootfs.sh` library. Because identity is re-derived from
the VM's own UUID, a restored/rebuilt VM is indistinguishable from a freshly
provisioned one of the same name. The VM stays `Stopped`; the operator starts
it when ready.

## Clone (create from snapshot)

`Virtual Machine Snapshot.clone_to_new_vm(title, ssh_public_key, …)` creates a
**new** VM whose initial disk is seeded from the snapshot's rootfs. The clone
is a fresh VM — new UUID, IPv6, MAC, SSH host keys and machine-id (all
re-derived at provision). It is a *disk template*, not a memory-state resume:
the safe path that avoids the duplicate-identity hazard of resuming the same
running state twice.

Mechanically the clone reuses the normal provision flow: the new VM row
carries an internal `clone_source_rootfs` field, and `provision-vm.sh` copies
from it instead of the pristine image (the kernel still comes from the image,
so the image must be synced). Disk defaults to the snapshot's size and can
only grow.

## Resize

`Virtual Machine.resize(vcpus, memory_megabytes, disk_gigabytes)` on a
**Stopped** VM. Firecracker reads `/machine-config` only at boot, so resize is
stop-required; the next Start picks up the new config. Runs
[`resize-vm.sh`](../scripts/resize-vm.sh): `jq`-edit `vcpu_count` /
`mem_size_mib` in `firecracker.json`, then grow `rootfs.ext4` to the new disk
size. Disk may only **grow** — ext4 shrink is unsafe and the on-host file is
already that large. Unspecified fields keep their current value. The new
values are persisted on the row through a guarded path (see
[Why resource fields are frozen outside resize](#why-resource-fields-are-frozen-outside-resize)).

## Terminate

Runs [`terminate-vm.sh`](../scripts/terminate-vm.sh), which:

1. `systemctl disable --now firecracker-vm@<uuid>.service` (no-op if already
   stopped).
2. Calls `vm-network-down.sh` defensively in case the unit's `ExecStopPost`
   didn't fire.
3. `rm -rf /var/lib/atlas/virtual-machines/<uuid>` and removes the API
   socket.

Then Python sets `status = Terminated` and deletes the VM's
`Virtual Machine Snapshot` rows — the `rm -rf` above already removed their
on-host files, so the rows would otherwise dangle. **The UUID does not
change.** The Task row that did the terminate remains attached to the
terminated VM.

If the Terminate Task fails (SSH dropped, script error, etc.), the row stays
in its prior status. The operator clicks Terminate again — the script is
idempotent (each step is a no-op if its target is already gone), so a
second invocation is the correct retry.

## The systemd unit

[`scripts/systemd/firecracker-vm@.service`](../scripts/systemd/firecracker-vm@.service) is the
canonical artifact. Highlights:

- `Restart=always` with `RestartSec=5s` — if Firecracker dies, systemd
  brings it back. "Keep them running."
- `ExecStartPost=/var/lib/atlas/bin/vm-network-up.sh %i` and the matching
  `ExecStopPost` for `vm-network-down.sh`. Networking is part of the unit's
  lifecycle, so a host reboot brings VMs back with networking intact.
- `--config-file` is used, not the API socket, during boot. Fewer moving
  parts. The API socket is still created (`--api-sock`) and is used after boot
  by `pause-vm.sh` / `resume-vm.sh`. Snapshot/restore/rebuild/resize do **not**
  touch the socket — they are disk and config operations on a Stopped VM.

## Host reboot recovery

Because every `firecracker-vm@<uuid>.service` is `WantedBy=multi-user.target`,
a host reboot brings them all back. `vm-network-up.sh` re-creates the tap
and nft rules from `/var/lib/atlas/virtual-machines/<uuid>/network.env`,
which was written at provision time. No Atlas-side intervention needed; the
Frappe DB does not have to be consulted on host reboot.

## Why resource fields are frozen outside resize

`server`, `image`, and `ssh_public_key` are immutable for the VM's lifetime —
they pin identity and what the rootfs was built against. To change them, the
operator terminates and provisions anew.

`vcpus`, `memory_megabytes`, and `disk_gigabytes` are *frozen on ordinary
saves* but mutable through `resize()` on a Stopped VM. The freeze is the
drift guard: the on-host VM must match the doc, so we never let an idle form
save silently desync the config from reality. `resize()` is the one path that
changes both together — it sets the new values **and** rewrites the on-host
config/disk in the same gesture, so they can't drift. The controller's
`validate()` enforces this: it adds the resource fields to the immutable set
unless `flags.resizing` is set (only `resize()` sets it). The framework
`set_only_once` flag was removed from these three fields so the controller is
the single gate.

This is the deliberate reversal of the original building-block stance ("change
CPU/RAM by terminating and reprovisioning"). Snapshots, restore/rebuild,
clone, resize and pause are now first-class — but each is constrained (disk
operations require Stopped, snapshots are disk-only, disk only grows) so the
on-host state stays derivable from the doc.
