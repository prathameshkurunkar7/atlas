# Virtual machine lifecycle

The core lifecycle is **provision, start, stop, terminate**. On top of it sit
the disk- and state-management operations: **snapshot, restore/rebuild, clone,
resize, pause/resume**. Each operation is exactly one Task running one
idempotent shell script.

Two design rules keep this set small and safe:

- **Operator snapshots are disk-only.** A `Virtual Machine Snapshot` is an LVM
  thin CoW snapshot of the VM's disk LV — never a Firecracker memory-state
  artifact, so it dodges the RAM-sized file and the duplicate-identity hazard
  the [Firecracker docs](../../references/firecracker/docs/snapshotting/snapshot-support.md)
  call insecure (one snapshot resumed twice is two guests with one identity).
  Firecracker's `/snapshot/create` + `/snapshot/load` **are** used — but only
  by the internal [fast stop/start path](#memory-snapshots-fast-stop--start):
  one ephemeral, host-local memory snapshot per VM, written at stop and
  consumed by the next start, never an operator-facing object and never
  restored twice. The pre-boot-only load path (which can't coexist with our
  `--config-file` boot) is handled by the launcher's marker conditional.
- **Disk operations default to Stopped.** A CoW snapshot of (or a replacement
  under) an ext4 the guest still has mounted is *crash-consistent* — atomic at
  the block layer, but missing unflushed guest-cache writes and dependent on
  journal replay; a cleanly unmounted disk LV is flush-clean and, with two disks,
  mutually consistent. Restore/rebuild/resize stay Stopped-only (resize also
  because Firecracker reads `/machine-config` pre-boot only). **Snapshot is the
  one exception:** `snapshot(live=True)` takes a crash-consistent snapshot of a
  Running/Paused VM without stopping (see [Snapshot](#snapshot)). The desk
  surfaces the Stopped-only actions while Stopped and **Snapshot (live)** while
  Running/Paused; the controllers enforce the rules.

Two operations touch Firecracker's API socket: **pause/resume**
(`PATCH /vm {Paused|Resumed}`) — a runtime vCPU freeze that keeps RAM
resident, distinct from Stop — and the **memory-snapshot fast stop/start**
(`PUT /snapshot/create` at stop, `PUT /snapshot/load` at start; see
[Memory snapshots](#memory-snapshots-fast-stop--start)).

## Identity

A `Virtual Machine.name` is a **UUID** assigned at insert. It never changes —
including on terminate. This means:

- The on-host directory path
  (`/var/lib/atlas/virtual-machines/<uuid>/`) is stable forever.
- The systemd unit instance name (`firecracker-vm@<uuid>.service`) is stable.
- Tasks referencing the VM stay valid after terminate.
- The operator does not have to invent a name; they use `title` for a
  human-readable label (the framework's `title_field`).

The MAC and TAP device are derived from the UUID so they are also stable.

## States

```
                  (insert via Create form — Save)
                              |
                              v
                          Pending ----(provision fails)----> Failed
                              |                                 |
                  (auto_provision worker)            (Provision retry)
                              |                                 |
                              v                                 |
                          Running <----------------------------+
                          ^   |  ^
                  (Resume)|   |  |(Start)
                          |   |  |
                       Paused |  Stopped
                          ^   |   ^  |
                   (Pause)|   +---+  |  (Snapshot / Rebuild / Restore / Resize
                          |  (Stop)  |   all stay Stopped)
                          +----------+

       (Terminate from any non-Terminated state) ---> Terminated
```

Statuses: `Pending`, `Running`, `Paused`, `Stopped`, `Failed`, `Terminated`.

Status checks treat this as an **open set** — controllers guard on the
specific states a transition allows, never "anything but X". `stop()` accepts
`Running` *or* `Paused`; `pause()` only `Running`; `resume()` only `Paused`;
`start()` only `Stopped`; `restart()` only `Running`/`Stopped` (a Paused VM
resumes or stops first). The disk operations (snapshot, rebuild, restore,
resize) require `Stopped`.

Two transitions carry an additional, operator-set **protection** gate
orthogonal to status (see [Stop / Terminate protection](#stop--terminate-protection)):
`stop()` is refused while `stop_protection` is set, and `terminate()` while
`termination_protection` is set. Both default off; both are hard throws, not
confirmations.

There is no transient `Provisioning` status — the Task row is the "in-flight"
record; the VM row only moves to `Running` after a successful Provision Task,
and stays at `Pending` if it fails (re-clickable because the script is
idempotent).

`Paused` keeps the microVM's RAM resident with vCPUs frozen; the systemd unit
is still active. It is reached only from `Running` and leaves to `Running`
(resume) or `Stopped` (stop = full shutdown).

`Terminated` is terminal. The doc stays in the table forever for history;
terminating a VM also deletes its snapshot rows. Each snapshot row's `on_trash`
lvremoves its snapshot LV — snapshot LVs live in the thin pool, outside the VM
directory, so they survive `terminate-vm.py`'s `rm -rf` and must be removed
explicitly (one Task each).

## Provision

Trigger: operator fills the Create form (server, image, vCPUs, RAM,
disk, SSH key, title) and clicks `Save`. `Virtual Machine.after_insert`
enqueues `auto_provision` on the `long` queue; the worker calls
`Virtual Machine.provision()` on the freshly inserted row. There is no
operator-facing `Provision` primary on a `Pending` form — saving *is*
the provision trigger. The `Provision` primary returns on `Failed` as
a manual retry path.

Steps in Python (one DocType method, `Virtual Machine.provision`):

1. **Allocate networking values** in the Frappe DB:
   - `ipv6_address`: next free address in `Server.ipv6_virtual_machine_range`.
     The allocator selects `Server` for update, scans existing
     `Virtual Machine.ipv6_address` for that server, picks the next, commits.
   - `mac_address`: `06:00:` + first 4 bytes of the UUID, hex-formatted.
   - `tap_device`: `atlas-` + first 9 chars of the UUID with `-` removed.
     Linux `IFNAMSIZ` is 16 *bytes* including the null terminator, so the
     usable interface-name length is 15: `atlas-` (6) + 9 = 15 exactly.

2. **Run the provisioning task**:
   `run_task(server=name, script="provision-vm.py", variables=…,
   virtual_machine=name)`. The script's step 0 verifies the image is on the
   server; if not, it exits non-zero with a clear error pointing the operator
   at the **Sync to Server** action. Provision does not auto-sync — image
   sync is a multi-minute operation and we want it deliberate, predictable,
   and visible as its own Task. The remaining steps (thin-snapshot the base
   image LV into the VM's disk LV, resize,
   SSH key injection, per-VM hostname `atlas-<first-8-of-uuid>` written to
   `/etc/hostname` and `/etc/hosts`, fresh per-VM
   `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*` keypairs, per-VM `/etc/machine-id`, config
   write, systemd enable+start) happen inside the same SSH session.
   The per-VM identity writes share the rootfs mount with the SSH-key
   injection — no per-VM systemd unit needed. See
   [`atlas/scripts/provision-vm.py`](../scripts/provision-vm.py).

3. **Update status**: on Task success, `status = Running`,
   `last_started = now()`.

One Task per VM creation. (The image sync, if needed, is a separate Task
triggered explicitly by the operator before provisioning.)

### Host-side precondition

Before the guest-side probe runs, the e2e suite asserts the Atlas
host carries the SSH key on disk as
[07-filesystem-layout.md § SSH keys](./07-filesystem-layout.md)
describes: `Atlas Settings.ssh_private_key_path` resolves to a regular
file with mode `0600` (or `0400`, equally safe). This is a Python-side
check in
[`use_cases/virtual_machine_provisioning.py::_assert_provider_ssh_key_path`](../atlas/tests/e2e/use_cases/virtual_machine_provisioning.py),
not a bash probe — the file lives on the Atlas host, not in the guest.
A missing or wrong-mode key surfaces here as a clean AssertionError
rather than as a noisy SSH timeout in the guest probe.

### Guest-side identity contract

A freshly provisioned VM presents the following to an operator who SSHes
in. These are the contract `provision-vm.py` writes and the e2e suite
([`phase5-guest-identity.sh`](../atlas/tests/e2e/scripts/phase5-guest-identity.sh))
asserts on every run:

- `hostname` is `atlas-<first-8-of-uuid>`. Same string in `/etc/hostname`
  and as a `127.0.1.1` entry in `/etc/hosts`.
- `/etc/machine-id` is unique per VM (derived from the UUID; the leaked
  CI value `4833ad8775a24dcc9d4b159af4e84d08` is gone).
- `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*` keypairs are unique per VM — generated on the
  host at **provision** time with `ssh-keygen` (replacing the base image's
  shared baked keys, so the CI build-container comment `root@bf0feaa40806`
  does not appear). They are the VM's **SSH identity** and are **preserved**
  across rebuild/restore (changing them would break clients' `known_hosts`);
  the operator rotates them deliberately via [Regenerate host keys](#regenerate-host-keys).
- The only global IPv4 on `eth0` is the Atlas NAT44 egress address
  (`100.64.x.x/30`, see [06-networking.md](./06-networking.md)). The
  `fcnet.service` that derived a phantom `91.83.x.x/30` from the MAC is
  removed at image-sync time, so any *non-`100.64`* global v4 is a
  regression. (The egress address and its reachability are asserted
  separately by the `phase5-ipv4-egress.sh` probe.)
- `/etc/hosts` has no Docker bridge leftover; just localhost, the
  per-VM 127.0.1.1 line, and the ip6-* aliases.
- Root password locked (`root:!:` in `/etc/shadow`). `sshd -T` reports
  `passwordauthentication no` — key-only by contract.

This list is short for a reason: it is the operator-visible delta
between a stock Ubuntu cloud image and a VM that looks like the
operator's own. When the upstream image changes, every bullet either
stays a no-op (good) or needs a new strip (a regression to fix in
`sync-image.py`).

## Data disk

A VM may carry an optional **second writable disk** — a first-class **peer of
the root disk** that rides through every disk operation with the same
mechanisms. It is set by three fields ([02-doctypes.md](./02-doctypes.md)):
`data_disk_gigabytes` (0 = none), `data_disk_format_and_mount` (default on),
and `data_disk_mount_point` (default `/home`).

- **Backing.** A blank thin volume `atlas-data-<uuid>` in the same pool (no
  origin — its bytes are private), exposed into the jail as a second
  block-special node `data.ext4` and attached as a non-root Firecracker drive,
  so the guest sees it as `/dev/vda`'s peer `/dev/vdb`.
- **Format + mount.** When `data_disk_format_and_mount` is on, `provision-vm.py`
  lays down `ext4` labelled `atlas-data` (once, on first creation — never
  reformatted, so data is never wiped) and `inject_identity` appends a
  `LABEL=atlas-data  <mount_point>  ext4  defaults,nofail  0 2` line to the
  guest's `/etc/fstab` (the same `LABEL=` idiom the root fs uses, so it survives
  the per-VM UUID reroll). Off → a raw, unformatted, unmounted `/dev/vdb`.
- **Parity across operations.** Snapshot captures it too; Restore and Clone
  recreate it from the snapshot; Resize grows it; Terminate removes it; the
  host-reboot disk hook re-activates it. The exception is Rebuild-from-image,
  which has no image source for data and so **preserves** the live data disk.
  Each operation's section below notes its data-disk behavior.

The data disk's whole lifecycle lives in the same scripts as the root disk
(`prepare_data_lv` in [`scripts/lib/atlas/rootfs.py`](../scripts/lib/atlas/rootfs.py),
`ThinPool.data_disk` / `data_snapshot` in [`lvm.py`](../scripts/lib/atlas/lvm.py)).

## Start / Stop / Restart

Each is a single Task:

- `start-vm.py`: `systemctl start firecracker-vm@<name>.service` (the host
  decides cold boot vs. memory restore on its own — see
  [Memory snapshots](#memory-snapshots-fast-stop--start)), plus a one-shot
  cold retry when a restore attempt failed mid-start.
- `stop-vm.py` (the default): `systemctl stop firecracker-vm@<name>.service`
- `snapshot-stop-vm.py` (opt-in: the VM's `memory_snapshot_on_stop` is
  checked, or the caller passed `stop(memory_snapshot=True)`):
  pause → `PUT /snapshot/create` → marker → `systemctl stop`; any snapshot
  failure falls back to the plain stop inside the same Task.
- `terminate-vm.py`: see below

Restart is stop then start, as the Python method's choice — we do not add a
`restart-vm.py`, because the only thing `systemctl restart` adds is one fewer
network round-trip and we already paid for both. **On a VM opted into memory
snapshots, a restart is a state-preserving power cycle, not a guest reboot** —
the stop saves the guest's RAM and the start resumes it, so a wedged guest
stays wedged. `restart(cold=True)` is the true-reboot escape hatch (plain
stop, full cold boot); a VM that never opted in restarts cold as it always
did.

Status updates happen after the Task succeeds. We do not poll the server
to verify; the source of truth is the Task. If the operator wants ground
truth, they click `Run Task` with `script=systemctl status ...`.

## Memory snapshots: fast stop / start

A cold boot takes 60–120s to a usable guest; loading a saved memory state
takes milliseconds. So an **opted-in** `stop()` captures the VM's **full
memory state** (vmstate + guest RAM, Firecracker's `/snapshot/create`) before
shutting the unit down, and the next `start()` resumes the guest exactly
where it paused instead of booting it. Per-VM `memory_snapshot_on_stop`
(default **off** — the plain stop and cold boot remain the default path)
selects the fast stop, as does a one-off `stop(memory_snapshot=True)`;
`has_memory_snapshot` (read-only) records whether the last stop actually
captured one.

**The fast path runs only when the last working state was fully snapshotted;
everything else takes the default path.** Concretely, the contract is one
marker file:

- The snapshot pair lives inside the jail at `snapshot/{vmstate.bin,mem.bin}`
  with a `snapshot/READY` marker written **last**, only after Firecracker
  reports the pair complete. No marker — for any reason — means the next start
  is a plain cold boot.
- `snapshot-stop-vm.py` pre-flights (launcher generation, API socket, free
  space for a RAM-sized file) and **falls back to the plain stop inside the
  same Task** on any failure, emitting `memory_snapshot=false` plus the
  reason. The VM always ends up Stopped; only the next start's speed differs.
- At start, the per-VM launcher checks the marker: present → Firecracker
  starts **idle** (no `--config-file`; `/snapshot/load` is pre-boot only and
  cannot coexist with it); absent → the normal `--config-file` cold boot. The
  unit's `ExecStartPost` hook (`vm-restore.py`) then loads the snapshot,
  **consumes the marker before resuming the guest**, and resumes. Once the
  guest runs it writes to its disk, so the saved RAM no longer matches the
  disk — consuming the marker first guarantees the same snapshot is never
  restored twice (the duplicate/stale-identity hazard).
- A failed restore self-heals: `vm-restore.py` removes the marker and exits
  non-zero; the unit fails, `Restart=always` relaunches it, and the
  marker-less launcher cold-boots. `start-vm.py` recognizes that exact
  signature (marker present before, gone after, start failed) and retries the
  start synchronously so the Task ends green and the row stays truthful.

**Invalidation.** Saved RAM is only restorable against the exact disk and
machine config it was paused over, so every mutation of either removes the
on-host snapshot directory and clears `has_memory_snapshot`: rebuild/restore
(`rebuild-vm.py`), resize (`resize-vm.py`), host-key rotation
(`regenerate-host-keys-vm.py`), and re-provision (`provision-vm.py`).
Terminate's `rm -rf` of the VM directory sweeps it with the jail. A disk
snapshot of a Stopped VM mutates nothing and leaves it valid.

**Semantics and limits, deliberately accepted:**

- A restored guest never observes a reboot, and its clock is stale by the
  stopped interval until NTP (`systemd-timesyncd` in the Ubuntu images)
  corrects it. Long-stopped VMs may see TLS/cert and TCP oddities until then.
- The memory file is RAM-sized on the host filesystem (not the thin pool) for
  the duration of the stop; the pre-flight refuses the fast path when space
  is short.
- The snapshot is **host-local ephemeral state, a cache** — it is never
  synced to Frappe, never survives terminate, and losing it costs only a
  cold boot. The Frappe DB stays the source of truth for everything durable
  (spec principle 2); `has_memory_snapshot` is bookkeeping, not authority:
  the host marker decides at start time.
- A snapshot written by one Firecracker binary may be refused by another
  (host upgraded between stop and start). That surfaces as a failed load and
  takes the self-healing cold-boot path above — no version bookkeeping needed.
- Launchers generated before this feature always pass `--config-file`, so
  `snapshot-stop-vm.py` detects them and falls back; re-provisioning
  regenerates the launcher and enables the fast path.

## Warm snapshot fan-out: one golden, N restored clones

The fast stop/start above is Firecracker's *secure* shape — one snapshot, one
VM, resumed exactly once. Fan-out is the *other* shape: **one durable warm
golden snapshot restored into many brand-new clones**, cutting a clone's first
provision from a cold boot (~17s+ on a fast host, minutes under a shared-tier
CPU cap) to **low seconds** — the resumed guest is already booted, already
warm, already serving. Firecracker calls resuming one state more than once
"insecure by default" (duplicated identity, RNG, clocks); this section is the
discipline that makes it safe. The first consumer is self-serve signup
([14-self-serve.md](./14-self-serve.md)); the producer is the Image Builder's
warm bake ([15-image-builder.md](./15-image-builder.md)).

**The artifact.** A `Virtual Machine Snapshot` with `kind=Warm` is a **matched
pair captured at one paused instant** of a pre-warmed golden VM: the disk (an
ordinary LVM thin snapshot LV) plus the guest's full memory state
(`vmstate.bin` + `mem.bin`), written by `warm-snapshot-vm.py` to a durable
per-snapshot directory `/var/lib/atlas/snapshots/<name>/` beside a
`host-signature.json` (CPU model + flags hash + microcode, host kernel,
Firecracker version — `scripts/lib/atlas/hostinfo.py`). The pair is only valid
together: the frozen RAM's filesystem cache references exactly those disk
blocks. The row also captures the golden's **machine config** (vcpus, memory)
and **tap name** — the vmstate pins all three. No `READY` marker is ever left
in the *golden's* jail: the golden itself must never resume from the pair.

**Warm snapshots are per-server.** A memory snapshot only restores on a
matching CPU model / host kernel / Firecracker build (Intel↔AMD never; and
DigitalOcean's Premium tier guarantees only "one of the latest two" CPU
generations, with live migration free to move a droplet between physical
hosts). So the warm artifact lives and is resolved **by server**
(`placement.warm_bench_snapshot_for_server`), is never synced off the host,
and one current warm golden is kept per server (a new warm bake supersedes the
old row; its `on_trash` removes the LV and the memory directory). Like the
fast-path snapshot it is **a cache keyed by a DB row**: losing it costs a cold
boot, nothing durable.

**Restore as a provision mode.** A warm clone is an ordinary clone
(`clone_to_new_vm`) whose row carries `warm_snapshot`; `provision-vm.py` then
diverges from the cold path in exactly four ways:

- **The disk is a byte-exact CoW of the golden** — no grow, no
  `tune2fs -U random`, and **no identity injection**. Mounting and mutating
  the clone's disk offline would corrupt the resumed guest: the frozen
  kernel's ext4 caches (bitmaps, inodes, dentries) must keep matching the
  device underneath. This is also why a warm clone restores at the captured
  disk/vcpus/memory exactly (`clone_to_new_vm` rejects mismatched overrides;
  the cgroup CPU settings — `cpu_max_cores` and `cpu_mode` — stay free, being
  host-side and invisible to the guest).
- **The identity travels over MMDS, not the disk.** Every VM's
  `firecracker.json` now carries `mmds-config` (V1, eth0 — inert unless data
  is staged). Provision writes the clone's identity payload (uuid, hostname,
  machine-id, IPv6, the NAT44 /30, SSH public key — the same derivations
  `inject_identity` uses) to `metadata.json` in the jail. `vm-restore.py`
  PUTs it into MMDS between load and resume; on the cold-boot fallback the
  launcher preloads it via `--metadata`. The golden was baked with an
  **in-guest freshen unit** (`atlas-warm-freshen`, installed by the warm
  bake) alive mid-loop at capture: every clone wakes with it running, and it
  adopts the identity — fresh SSH host keys *first* (so the controller's
  first successful connection pins the clone's key, never the golden's),
  machine-id/hostname/authorized_keys, the on-disk network env (so a later
  plain reboot boots correctly), then the live addresses *last* (becoming
  reachable on the clone's own /128 is the externally visible "freshen
  done"), a time-sync kick, and `/etc/atlas-vm-uuid` as the applied marker.
- **The memory pair is hard-linked, the marker is per-clone.** Provision
  stages `snapshot/{vmstate.bin,mem.bin}` as **hard links to the durable
  golden files** (N clones CoW-share one read-only mem file; inodes stay
  root-owned 0644 so any per-VM uid can map them — `MAP_PRIVATE` never
  writes back), copies the host signature beside them, and writes the
  `READY` marker **last**. From there the fast-path machinery above runs
  unchanged: marker → idle launch → `vm-restore.py` loads, consumes the
  marker (only ever the marker — never the shared link targets), resumes.
  The pair is staged only when this provision *created* the disk (or a prior
  staging was never consumed): RAM must never be restored over a disk that
  has diverged.
- **The tap keeps the golden's name.** The vmstate binds the tap device by
  name, so the clone's row pins `tap_device` to the captured name and its
  netns recreates it verbatim — tap names are netns-scoped, so N clones never
  collide, and the host-side addresses/routes stay the clone's own.

**The compatibility guard.** Before loading, `vm-restore.py` compares the
staged `host-signature.json` against the live host. On mismatch (a live
migration under us, a kernel or Firecracker upgrade) it consumes the marker
and fails the start; the relaunch **cold-boots the warm disk** — slower,
always correct, and the `--metadata` path still delivers the clone its
identity, so the fallback clone is fully usable. The same-VM fast path stages
no signature (same host by construction) and skips the check. The per-server
resolution is therefore only an *optimistic* pick; the host guard is the
authority.

**Boot_id is the tell.** Two warm clones share one `boot_id` (both resumed
the same frozen instant) — accepted, like the stale clock. Everything
identity-bearing (host keys, machine-id, hostname, addresses) is per-clone by
the freshen, and the bake deletes the systemd random-seed. The kernel CSPRNG
is NOT left to Firecracker's VMGenID reseed alone: that reseed has a
documented race window, and two clones whose freshen won the race generated
**identical SSH host keys** on a real host — so the freshen first mixes
per-clone data into the entropy pool and forces a reseed (`RNDRESEEDCRNG`)
before any key material is generated. The e2e (`warm_restore`) uses the
shared boot_id as the proof that a restore — not a boot — happened.

## Stop / Terminate protection

Two optional, operator-set flags on `Virtual Machine` guard the destructive
transitions, independent of status:

- `stop_protection` gates `stop()` — and therefore `restart()`, which stops
  first.
- `termination_protection` gates `terminate()`.

Both **default off** (a new VM is freely stoppable and terminable, as before)
and both are **hard throws**, not confirmations: a protected `stop()`/
`terminate()` raises ("Disable stop/termination protection before …") and runs
no Task. To proceed, the operator unchecks the flag, **saves** the VM, then
clicks the action — the same deliberate two-step shape as the immutability
throws. The check is in the controller (`stop()` / `terminate()`), so it holds
on every path (desk button, SPA, direct API), not just the desk.

The two flags are independent. `terminate()` does not route through `stop()`
(it `systemctl disable --now`s the unit directly via `terminate-vm.py`), so a
VM can be termination-protected but freely stoppable, or stop-protected but
terminable — whichever the operator chose. Protection is purely a Frappe-side
guard on *initiating* the operation; it changes no on-host state and is not
consulted by any script.

## Pause / Resume

The only operations that talk to Firecracker's API socket. Each is one Task
running a one-line `curl`:

- `pause-vm.py`: `PATCH /vm {"state":"Paused"}` over the in-jail socket
  `…/<uuid>/jail/firecracker/<uuid>/root/run/firecracker.socket`.
  `Running` → `Paused`.
- `resume-vm.py`: `PATCH /vm {"state":"Resumed"}`. `Paused` → `Running`.

`curl --fail` so a refused state change surfaces as a failed Task rather than
a silent success. Idempotent: Firecracker accepts a redundant Pause/Resume.
RAM stays resident across a pause — this is *not* a shutdown. The boot path is
still `--config-file` (forwarded through the jailer); the socket is created by
Firecracker inside its jail and used only for these post-boot operations. It is
a host-filesystem unix socket, so the VM's network namespace does not affect
reaching it — `curl --unix-socket` talks to it from the host as before.

## Snapshot

A snapshot lives in one thin pool on one host — instant and space-thin, but not
durable (lose the pool and it is gone). To make one survive its host, back it up
to S3 and restore it later: [29](./29-snapshot-backup.md).

`Virtual Machine.snapshot(title=None, live=False)`. `title` is optional:
omitted (or blank), it defaults to `<vm title> — <YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm>`, so a
caller — the SPA's one-click snapshot, or a direct API call — need not invent a
name. The dashboard pre-fills the same default but lets the user edit it. Runs
[`snapshot-vm.py`](../scripts/snapshot-vm.py):

1. Pre-flight thin-pool check — refuse if the pool's `data_percent` or
   `metadata_percent` is ≥ 90%. A thin snapshot consumes no space up front, but
   every subsequent CoW write allocates from the pool; taking snapshots against
   an almost-full pool courts a pool-exhaustion stall. The
   [Firecracker docs](../../references/firecracker/docs/snapshotting/snapshot-support.md)
   warn unbounded snapshots are a DoS vector; pool-space accounting is the
   guard (no quota system this iteration).
2. `lvcreate -s atlas-vm-<uuid> -n atlas-snap-<snapshot-uuid>` — an instant CoW
   thin snapshot of the VM's disk LV. Pure host op, no jail interaction; the
   snapshot shares the disk's blocks until one side is written.
3. Emit the typed result `ATLAS_RESULT={"size_bytes": <n>}` (from `blockdev
   --getsize64` on the snapshot LV), which the controller parses back with
   `task_results.parse_result()` — the typed successor to the old `SIZE_BYTES=`
   stdout scrape.

When the VM has a **data disk**, the same Task also `lvcreate -s`'s a second CoW
snapshot `atlas-datasnap-<snapshot-uuid>` (same snapshot UUID) and emits its
`data_size_bytes`. One snapshot row therefore describes **both** disks — it
records `data_rootfs_path`, `data_size_bytes`, and the data disk's
size + mount config alongside the root fields.

### Consistency: Stopped (default) vs. `live`

`live` selects the consistency the snapshot is taken under; the host op and the
row are otherwise identical.

- **`live=False` (default) — Stopped-only, flush-clean.** Requires a `Stopped`
  VM. The guest has cleanly unmounted both filesystems (caches flushed, journals
  committed), so the LV bytes are a quiesced, consistent image, and with two
  disks the root/data pair is mutually consistent. The safe default.
- **`live=True` — snapshot a Running/Paused VM, crash-consistent.** Skips the
  stop. The LVM thin CoW snapshot is atomic *per volume*, but the captured image
  is **crash-consistent** — the bytes as of that instant, equivalent to a power
  cut: writes still in the guest's page cache (not yet on the virtio-blk device)
  are absent, and ext4 replays its journal on the next mount. The host cannot
  quiesce the guest first (there is no in-guest agent / `fsfreeze` path), and the
  root and data LVs are snapshotted microseconds apart, so cross-disk consistency
  is not guaranteed. This is the guarantee a cloud "crash-consistent volume
  snapshot" gives — appropriate for journaling filesystems and apps with their
  own crash recovery; stop first when you need a guaranteed-clean image. The desk
  exposes it as **Snapshot (live)** on a Running/Paused VM (a normal **Snapshot**
  remains a Stopped-only action).

The controller inserts a `Virtual Machine Snapshot` row (`Pending`), runs the
Task, then records `rootfs_path` (the snapshot's `/dev/atlas/atlas-snap-<uuid>`
device path), `size_bytes` (plus the data-disk fields above), and flips it to
`Available`. One snapshot = one row = one (or two) thin LV(s). Deleting the row
runs
[`delete-snapshot-vm.py`](../scripts/delete-snapshot-vm.py) via `on_trash`,
which `lvremove`s the snapshot LV — always, even for a Terminated VM, because
the snapshot LV lives in the pool (outside the VM directory) and is not swept by
terminate's `rm -rf`. See
[02-doctypes.md § Virtual Machine Snapshot](./02-doctypes.md#virtual-machine-snapshot).

### Capturing a warm snapshot from a live VM

`Virtual Machine.capture_warm_snapshot(title=None)` is the per-VM operator
action that produces a `kind=Warm` snapshot — the **capture half** of the Image
Builder's warm bake ([15-image-builder.md](./15-image-builder.md)), exposed
directly on a live VM. It runs
[`warm-snapshot-vm.py`](../scripts/warm-snapshot-vm.py): pause the running
guest's vCPUs, write the memory pair (`vmstate.bin` + `mem.bin`) **and** an LVM
thin disk snapshot at the *same* paused instant into the durable per-snapshot
directory `/var/lib/atlas/snapshots/<name>/` beside a `host-signature.json`,
then resume. The VM never stops — the warmth ends up in the durable artifact,
not in a stopped scratch VM. The row captures the machine config (`vcpus`,
`memory_megabytes`) and `tap_device` the frozen vmstate pins, then is folded to
`Available` with `size_bytes`, `memory_bytes`, and `host_signature` from the
Task result — the same shape `image_build._warm_snapshot` records.

- **Running or Paused only.** There has to be a live guest to freeze; a Stopped
  VM has no memory to capture (take a plain `snapshot()` instead). The capture
  script also refuses a VM with a **data disk** — warm snapshots are root-only.
- **Desk surface.** The VM form's `Actions ▾` shows **Warm snapshot** on a
  Running/Paused VM (beside *Snapshot (live)* and *Stop (memory snapshot)*); its
  prompt names a title and calls `capture_warm_snapshot`.
- **Method name.** It is `capture_warm_snapshot`, *not* `warm_snapshot`:
  `warm_snapshot` is the Link **field** that records the golden a warm clone was
  restored from, and a same-named method would be shadowed by the field value on
  a hydrated doc.
- **This action only *produces* the artifact.** The mechanics of the pair
  (per-server validity, the host-signature compatibility guard, hard-linked
  fan-out) and the discipline that makes restoring it *into clones* safe — the
  in-guest `atlas-warm-freshen` unit baked by the Image Builder warm bake — live
  in *Warm snapshot fan-out* above. An ad-hoc capture from a VM that was **not**
  baked with that freshen unit is fine to restore onto its own VM (the fast
  stop/start shape) but is not fan-out-safe; `clone_to_new_vm` is the consumer.

## Restore / Rebuild

One controller method, `Virtual Machine.rebuild(source_type, source)`, on a
**Stopped** VM. It replaces the VM's disk LV while keeping its identity
(name/UUID, IPv6, MAC, tap, SSH key). Two sources:

- `source_type="snapshot"` — **Restore**: roll the disk back to one of this
  VM's own snapshots. `source` is the snapshot row name; it must belong to
  this VM and be `Available`. (The Snapshot form's **Restore to VM** button
  calls the thin wrapper `Snapshot.restore_to_vm()`.)
- `source_type="image"` — **Rebuild**: lay down a fresh disk from a base image
  (wipes stored data). `source` defaults to the VM's current image.

Both run [`rebuild-vm.py`](../scripts/rebuild-vm.py): `lvremove` the old disk
LV, recreate it as a fresh CoW snapshot of the source LV (a snapshot LV for
Restore, the base image LV for Rebuild), grow it to the VM's disk size, then
re-inject this VM's identity (SSH authorized key, network env, hostname,
machine-id) via the shared `atlas.rootfs` module (the Python successor to the
`prepare-rootfs.sh` library), and re-`mknod` the jail's `rootfs.ext4` block node
(the new LV's dev_t can differ). The VM stays `Stopped`; the operator starts it
when ready.

**SSH host keys are PRESERVED** (`inject_identity(regenerate_host_keys=False)`).
They are the VM's SSH identity; a restore carries the VM's own keys in the
snapshot, and a rebuild keeps whatever the new disk has. Either way the VM's
host key does not change, so a rollback never trips clients' `known_hosts` with
a "host identity changed" refusal. (This is the bug-fix behavior — previously
every rebuild/restore regenerated random host keys and locked clients out.) To
*deliberately* change them, use [Regenerate host keys](#regenerate-host-keys);
note a **rebuild-from-image** comes up with the base image's *shared* baked host
keys until rotated.

**Data disk.** Restore recreates it too: `lvremove` the live data disk and
re-snapshot it from the snapshot's `atlas-datasnap-<id>` LV (a fresh host-side
UUID, the `atlas-data` label and contents preserved), then re-`mknod` the
`data.ext4` jail node. Rebuild-from-image has no data source, so it **leaves the
live data disk untouched** — wiping a user's `/home` on an OS rebuild would be a
footgun — and only re-injects its fstab line into the fresh rootfs. A restore of
a snapshot that captured no data disk likewise leaves the current one alone.

## Regenerate host keys

`Virtual Machine.regenerate_host_keys()` on a **Stopped** VM rotates the guest's
SSH host keys — the explicit, opt-in counterpart to the preserve-by-default rule
above. Runs [`regenerate-host-keys-vm.py`](../scripts/regenerate-host-keys-vm.py):
activate + mount the root LV on the host, replace `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*` with
fresh per-VM keys (the same `ssh-keygen` the provision path uses), unmount. The
VM stays `Stopped`; the next Start presents the new keys.

Use it when you actually want a new SSH identity — most commonly after a
**rebuild-from-image** (which comes up with the image's shared baked keys) or to
rotate a VM's keys on purpose. It necessarily invalidates clients' cached
`known_hosts` entry (they must `ssh-keygen -R <address>` and re-accept) — that is
the intended effect, which is exactly why it is a deliberate action and not a
side effect of rebuild/restore. Stopped-only because the host mounts the rootfs
to rewrite the keys. The desk surfaces it as a **Regenerate host keys** action
(with a confirm) on a Stopped VM.

## Clone (create from snapshot)

`Virtual Machine Snapshot.clone_to_new_vm(title, ssh_public_key, …)` creates a
**new** VM whose initial disk is seeded from the snapshot's rootfs. The clone
is a fresh VM — new UUID, IPv6, MAC, SSH host keys and machine-id (all
re-derived at provision). For the default `kind=Cold` snapshot it is a *disk
template*, not a memory-state resume: the safe path that avoids the
duplicate-identity hazard of resuming the same running state twice. A
`kind=Warm` snapshot clones into a **restored** VM instead — same method, but
the clone resumes the golden's frozen memory at the captured size and adopts
its identity post-resume (see *Warm snapshot fan-out* above).

Mechanically the clone reuses the normal provision flow: the new VM row
carries an internal `clone_source_rootfs` field (the snapshot's LV device
path), and `provision-vm.py` snapshots the clone's disk LV from that snapshot
LV instead of the base image LV (the kernel still comes from the image, so the
image must be synced). A snapshot-of-a-snapshot is an independent thin LV — the
clone never shares writable blocks with its source. Disk defaults to the
snapshot's size and can only grow.

The **data disk** clones too: the new VM carries the snapshot's data size +
mount config and an internal `clone_source_data_rootfs` (the snapshot's
`atlas-datasnap-<id>` path), and `provision-vm.py` seeds its data disk from that
LV — so the clone's `/home` comes up with the source's data (a fresh host-side
UUID, no shared writable blocks). A clone of a snapshot with no data disk has
none.

## Resize

`Virtual Machine.resize(vcpus, cpu_max_cores, cpu_mode, memory_megabytes, disk_gigabytes)`
on a **Stopped** VM. Firecracker reads `/machine-config` only at boot, so resize
is stop-required; the next Start picks up the new config. Runs
[`resize-vm.py`](../scripts/resize-vm.py): `jq`-edit `vcpu_count` /
`mem_size_mib` in `firecracker.json`, then `lvextend -r` the disk LV to the new
size (grows the LV and the ext4 on it in one shot). Disk may only **grow** —
`lvextend` refuses to shrink and is a clean no-op when the size is already met.
Unspecified fields keep their current value. The new
values are persisted on the row through a guarded path (see
[Why resource fields are frozen outside resize](#why-resource-fields-are-frozen-outside-resize)).

**Capacity gate.** Before it touches the host, resize checks that the host has room
for the *growth* (the positive per-axis deltas) against the host's full effective
budget — a resize must not silently oversubscribe RAM or disk on a full host. It
deliberately spends the arrival headroom reserve placement left free (that is what
the reserve is for). When the delta doesn't fit it raises `NoResizeCapacityError`
(a `NoCapacityError` subclass — the signal that the VM must migrate to grow, a
deferred case). See [28-placement.md](./28-placement.md).

**Data disk.** `resize(data_disk_gigabytes=…)` grows the data disk the same way
(`lvextend -r`, grow-only). Resize only ever **grows an existing** data disk:
adding one to a VM that never had one (0→N) would also need a new Firecracker
drive and fstab line, so the controller rejects it — recreate the VM instead.

**`cpu_max_cores` / `cpu_mode` and the re-provision gap.** `cpu_max_cores` is the
VM's guaranteed CPU bandwidth (distinct from `vcpus`, the guest `vcpu_count`), and
`cpu_mode` ([02 § Virtual Machine](./02-doctypes.md)) picks how it is enforced — a
hard cgroup `cpu.max` ceiling (`Hard cap`, the default) or a `cpu.weight` floor
plus a loose `cpu.max` burst ceiling (`Relaxed`). Both are baked into the per-VM
jailer launcher at provision time — `resize-vm.py` rewrites `firecracker.json` and
grows the disk but does **not** regenerate the launcher, so a changed share, mode,
or burst ceiling takes effect on the next **re-provision**, not the next Start.
This is the pre-existing behavior the whole-core `cpu.max` cap already has (a
`vcpus` resize never rewrote the launcher either). `resize()` still persists the
new values so the doc stays the source of truth and capacity accounting is
correct; it keeps a whole-core VM whole-core when `vcpus` changes without an
explicit share, and leaves `cpu_mode` untouched unless passed. Regenerating the
launcher on resize is a named follow-up (see [09-roadmap.md](./09-roadmap.md)).
The dashboard's Resize dialog stays vCPU / memory / disk; `cpu_max_cores` is set
from a size preset at create and `cpu_mode` from the desk form / API.

## Terminate

`terminate()` first refuses if `termination_protection` is set — a hard throw
("Disable termination protection before terminating this VM"), not a
confirmation. The operator unchecks the field, saves, and clicks Terminate
again. See [Stop / Terminate protection](#stop--terminate-protection).

Once past the gate it runs [`terminate-vm.py`](../scripts/terminate-vm.py),
which:

1. `systemctl disable --now firecracker-vm@<uuid>.service` (no-op if already
   stopped).
2. Calls `vm-network-down.py` defensively in case the unit's `ExecStopPost`
   didn't fire.
3. `rm -rf /var/lib/atlas/virtual-machines/<uuid>` (takes the jail tree,
   including the `rootfs.ext4` block node, with it) and removes the API socket.
4. `lvremove atlas-vm-<uuid>` — the VM's disk LV — and `lvremove
   atlas-data-<uuid>` — its data disk (a no-op when the VM had none). Guarded:
   the helper refuses to remove the thin pool or any `atlas-image-*` base LV, so
   a teardown bug can never destroy shared state. The VM's snapshot LVs (root and
   data) are **not** removed here (their names aren't derivable from the VM UUID)
   — they go via the per-snapshot delete path below.

Then Python sets `status = Terminated`, **detaches the VM's `Reserved IP`** (if
any) back to its Server's pool — clearing the VM's `public_ipv4` and leaving the
`Reserved IP` row `Allocated` and re-attachable — and deletes the VM's
`Virtual Machine Snapshot` rows; each row's `on_trash` `lvremove`s its snapshot
LV (those live in the pool, outside the VM directory, so step 3's `rm -rf` did
not touch them). **The UUID does not change.** The Task row that did the
terminate remains attached to the terminated VM.

If the Terminate Task fails (SSH dropped, script error, etc.), the row stays
in its prior status. The operator clicks Terminate again — the script is
idempotent (each step is a no-op if its target is already gone), so a
second invocation is the correct retry.

## The systemd unit

[`scripts/systemd/firecracker-vm@.service`](../scripts/systemd/firecracker-vm@.service) is the
canonical artifact. Highlights:

- `Restart=always` with `RestartSec=5s` — if Firecracker dies, systemd
  brings it back. "Keep them running."
- **`ExecStart` runs a per-VM launcher that execs the `jailer`, not
  `firecracker` directly.** The launcher (`…/%i/jailer-launch.sh`, generated by
  `provision-vm.py`) builds the jailer command line and `exec`s it; the jailer
  drops the Firecracker process to the VM's per-VM uid/gid, chroots it into
  `…/<uuid>/jail/firecracker/<uuid>/root`, applies cgroup-v2 memory/CPU caps
  and fd/file rlimits, and joins the VM's network namespace (`--netns`).
  Everything after `--` is forwarded to Firecracker, with paths relative to the
  jail root (`--config-file firecracker.json`, `--api-sock run/firecracker.socket`).
  The launcher exists — rather than putting the jailer line straight in
  `ExecStart` — because `--cgroup cpu.max=<quota> <period>` carries a value with
  an internal space, and systemd word-splits an unquoted `$VAR` in `ExecStart`
  on *every* space, which would shatter that value into a stray positional the
  jailer rejects. (A `Relaxed`-mode VM additionally emits `--cgroup cpu.weight=<w>`
  alongside a loosened `cpu.max`; the launcher carries both the same way.) The per-VM uid, netns name and cgroup/rlimit flags are baked
  into the launcher at provision time: `provision-vm.py` receives the cgroup and
  resource limits as repeatable `--cgroup-arg` / `--resource-arg` flags (one argv
  token per value, `shlex.quote`'d, so `cpu.max`'s internal space survives) and
  writes each as its own continued line in the launcher's `exec`. The real argv
  vector means the shell's `mapfile` dance is gone entirely. The unit template
  stays static and the launcher is regenerated on every (re)provision.
- `ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/python3 /var/lib/atlas/bin/vm-network-up.py %i`
  (creates the netns + veth + in-namespace tap, so they exist when the jailer
  joins the namespace) and the matching `ExecStopPost` for `vm-network-down.py`.
  A third `ExecStartPre` runs `vm-disk-up.py %i` to re-activate the VM's disk LV
  and refresh its in-jail block node (needed after a host reboot, when
  activation-skip snapshots don't auto-activate). `ExecStartPre` runs
  to completion before `ExecStart`, so the namespace is ready at jailer exec.
  Networking is part of the unit's lifecycle, so a host reboot brings VMs back
  with networking intact.
- Two earlier `ExecStartPre` lines clean the jail for a fresh launch: the jailer
  `mknod()`s its device nodes (`/dev/net/tun`, `/dev/kvm`, …) inside the jail on
  *every* start and aborts with `EEXIST` if they already exist, but the jail root
  persists on disk across stop/start — so we `rm -rf` the jailer-owned `dev/`
  (and the stale API socket) first. Without this, the first Stop→Start cycle
  fails ("Failed to create /dev/net/tun via mknod: File exists"). The rootfs,
  kernel and config alongside `dev/` are left untouched.
- `ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/python3 /var/lib/atlas/bin/vm-restore.py %i` — the
  memory-snapshot restore hook. No marker → exit 0 (the common cold boot).
  Marker → load the snapshot over the API socket, consume the marker, resume.
  See [Memory snapshots](#memory-snapshots-fast-stop--start). The pre-start
  jail cleanup above deliberately does NOT touch `snapshot/`.
- `KillMode=mixed` — the jailer is the unit's main process and Firecracker is
  its child; mixed sends SIGTERM to the jailer and SIGKILL to the whole cgroup,
  so the jailed Firecracker dies with the unit rather than being orphaned.
- `--config-file` is used, not the API socket, during a cold boot. Fewer
  moving parts. The API socket is still created (`--api-sock`) inside the jail
  and used after boot by `pause-vm.py` / `resume-vm.py`, and at stop/start by
  the memory-snapshot path (`snapshot-stop-vm.py` / `vm-restore.py`). When a
  memory snapshot is pending, the launcher omits `--config-file` so Firecracker
  starts idle for the pre-boot-only `/snapshot/load`. Disk
  snapshot/restore/rebuild/resize do **not** touch the socket — they are disk
  and config operations on a Stopped VM.

## Host reboot recovery

Because every `firecracker-vm@<uuid>.service` is `WantedBy=multi-user.target`,
a host reboot brings them all back. `vm-network-up.py` re-creates the network
namespace, veth pair, in-namespace tap and nft rules from
`/var/lib/atlas/virtual-machines/<uuid>/network.env`; `vm-disk-up.py`
re-activates the VM's disk LVs (the thin snapshots carry LVM's activation-skip
flag and their dev_t can renumber across a reboot) and refreshes the
`rootfs.ext4` jail node — and the `data.ext4` node too when the VM has a data
disk; the unit then re-execs the per-VM `jailer-launch.sh`, which has the per-VM
uid/caps/netns baked in. All artifacts were written at provision time and
survive the reboot on disk. No Atlas-side intervention needed; the Frappe DB
does not have to be consulted on host reboot.

A pending memory snapshot survives the reboot too (it is plain files in the
jail), so a VM that was fast-stopped before the host went down comes back by
**resuming its saved state** rather than cold-booting — the launcher and
`vm-restore.py` key off the marker exactly as on an ordinary start. A VM that
was *Running* at reboot lost its RAM with the host; it has no marker and
cold-boots as before.

## Why resource fields are frozen outside resize

`server`, `image`, and `ssh_public_key` are immutable for the VM's lifetime —
they pin identity and what the rootfs was built against. To change them, the
operator terminates and provisions anew.

`vcpus`, `memory_megabytes`, and `disk_gigabytes` are *frozen on ordinary
saves* but mutable through `resize()` on a Stopped VM. The freeze is the
drift guard: the on-host VM must match the doc, so we never let an idle form
save silently desync the config from reality. `resize()` is the one path that
changes both together — it sets the new values **and** rewrites the on-host
config/disk in the same gesture, so they can't drift. The controller's
`validate()` enforces this: it adds the resource fields to the immutable set
unless `flags.resizing` is set (only `resize()` sets it). The framework
`set_only_once` flag was removed from these three fields so the controller is
the single gate.

This is the deliberate reversal of the original building-block stance ("change
CPU/RAM by terminating and reprovisioning"). Snapshots, restore/rebuild,
clone, resize and pause are now first-class — but each is constrained (disk
operations require Stopped, snapshots are disk-only, disk only grows) so the
on-host state stays derivable from the doc.
