# Virtual machine lifecycle

The lifecycle is intentionally narrow: **provision, start, stop, delete**. No
resize, no migrate, no snapshot, no clone. Changing CPU/RAM means archiving
and provisioning a new VM. Each operation is exactly one Task.

## Identity

A `Virtual Machine.name` is a **UUID** assigned at insert. It never changes —
including on archive. This means:

- The on-host directory path
  (`/var/lib/atlas/virtual-machines/<uuid>/`) is stable forever.
- The systemd unit instance name (`firecracker-vm@<uuid>.service`) is stable.
- Tasks referencing the VM stay valid after archive.
- The operator does not have to invent a name; they use `description` for a
  human-readable label.

The MAC and TAP device are derived from the UUID so they are also stable.

## States

```
                  (insert via Create dialog)
                              |
                              v
                          Pending
                              |
                  (Provision button)
                              |
                              v
                       Provisioning
                              |
                  +-----------+-----------+
                  v                       v
              Running                 Failed
                  |                       |
       (Stop)     |                       | (Delete cleans up)
                  v                       v
              Stopped                 Archived
                  |
       (Start)    |
                  +---> Running
                          |
       (Delete from any non-Archived state)
                          v
                       Archived
```

`Archived` is terminal. The doc stays in the table forever for history.

## Provision

Trigger: operator fills the Create dialog (server, image, vCPUs, RAM, disk,
SSH key, description) and clicks `Provision`.

Steps in Python (one DocType method, `Virtual Machine.provision`):

1. **Allocate networking values** in the Frappe DB:
   - `ipv6_address`: next free address in `Server.ipv6_virtual_machine_range`.
     The allocator selects `Server` for update, scans existing
     `Virtual Machine.ipv6_address` for that server, picks the next, commits.
   - `mac_address`: `06:00:` + first 4 bytes of the UUID, hex-formatted.
   - `tap_device`: `atlas-` + first 10 chars of the UUID with `-` removed.
     Linux IFNAMSIZ is 16; `atlas-` (6) + 10 = 16 exactly.

2. **Ensure the image is on the server**. If not, run `sync-image.sh` (this
   is its own Task; provisioning waits on it).

3. **Run the provisioning task**:
   `run_task(server, "provision-vm.sh", variables, virtual_machine=name)`.
   The script does everything else inside one SSH session (rootfs copy,
   resize, SSH key injection, config write, systemd enable+start). See
   [`atlas/scripts/provision-vm.sh`](../scripts/provision-vm.sh).

4. **Update status**: on Task success, `status = Running`,
   `last_started = now()`.

This is one Task per VM creation. Two on the first VM of an image on a
server (one for the image sync).

## Start / Stop / Restart

Each is a single Task running a one-line script:

- `start-vm.sh`: `systemctl start firecracker-vm@<name>.service`
- `stop-vm.sh`: `systemctl stop firecracker-vm@<name>.service`
- `delete-vm.sh`: see below

Restart is `stop-vm.sh` then `start-vm.sh`, but as the Python method's
choice — we do not add a `restart-vm.sh`, because the only thing `systemctl
restart` adds is one fewer network round-trip and we already paid for both.

Status updates happen after the Task succeeds. We do not poll the server
to verify; the source of truth is the Task. If the operator wants ground
truth, they click `Run Task` with `script=systemctl status ...`.

## Delete

Runs [`delete-vm.sh`](../scripts/delete-vm.sh), which:

1. `systemctl disable --now firecracker-vm@<uuid>.service` (no-op if already
   stopped).
2. Calls `vm-network-down.sh` defensively in case the unit's `ExecStopPost`
   didn't fire.
3. `rm -rf /var/lib/atlas/virtual-machines/<uuid>` and removes the API
   socket.

Then Python sets `status = Archived`. **The UUID does not change.** The Task
row that did the delete remains attached to the archived VM.

## The systemd unit

[`scripts/systemd/firecracker-vm@.service`](../scripts/systemd/firecracker-vm@.service) is the
canonical artifact. Highlights:

- `Restart=always` with `RestartSec=5s` — if Firecracker dies, systemd
  brings it back. "Keep them running."
- `ExecStartPost=/var/lib/atlas/bin/vm-network-up.sh %i` and the matching
  `ExecStopPost` for `vm-network-down.sh`. Networking is part of the unit's
  lifecycle, so a host reboot brings VMs back with networking intact.
- `--config-file` is used, not the API socket, during boot. Fewer moving
  parts. The API socket is still created for future post-boot operations.

## Host reboot recovery

Because every `firecracker-vm@<uuid>.service` is `WantedBy=multi-user.target`,
a host reboot brings them all back. `vm-network-up.sh` re-creates the tap
and nft rules from `/var/lib/atlas/virtual-machines/<uuid>/network.env`,
which was written at provision time. No Atlas-side intervention needed; the
Frappe DB does not have to be consulted on host reboot.

## Why immutable resource fields

`server`, `image`, `vcpus`, `memory_megabytes`, `disk_gigabytes` are not
editable after first provision. To change them, the operator archives the VM
and provisions a new one. This keeps the on-host state derivable from the
doc — no migration logic, no resize commands, no out-of-sync moments. The
moment we let those fields change, we add code paths that have to handle
"the on-host VM was provisioned with the old values, now the doc says
something else". Not worth it for the building block.
