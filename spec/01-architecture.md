## Components

### Atlas (this app)

A Frappe app installed on `atlas.local`. It owns the database of servers and
virtual machines, exposes Desk forms for the operator, and runs background
jobs that SSH into servers to make changes.

There is no Atlas agent on the server. Everything Atlas does on a server is
the result of one SSH invocation that runs one shell script. The script comes
from this repository, under [`atlas/scripts/`](../scripts/). The Frappe code
uploads the script, runs it, and records the result.

### Server Provider

For this iteration there is one provider: DigitalOcean. The
`Server Provider` document stores the DO API token and the defaults Atlas
uses to create droplets. The provider knows how to create and delete a
droplet. It does nothing else.

The provider abstraction exists so we can later add a "bare metal" provider
without changing how virtual machines are managed. It is not designed for
multi-cloud; only one type is implemented at a time.

### Server

A `Server` document represents one droplet. It is created by clicking
"Provision Server" on a `Server Provider`, which calls the DO API, inserts a
`Server` document, waits for SSH, then bootstraps the host.

### Virtual Machine

A `Virtual Machine` document represents one Firecracker microVM running on
one server. The operator picks the server at creation time. The buttons on
the form (`Provision`, `Start`, `Stop`, `Delete`) translate to one task each.

### Virtual Machine Image

A kernel + rootfs pair. One image for this iteration: Ubuntu 24.04 from
Firecracker CI. Image bytes live on each server under
`/var/lib/atlas/images/`; the document tracks the canonical URLs and
checksums.

### Task

Every shell script Atlas runs against a server is persisted as a `Task`
document. It captures the script path, the input variables, stdout, stderr,
exit code, timing, and the user who triggered it. This is our audit log and
our debugger.

## Data flow: provisioning a virtual machine

```
operator clicks Provision on a Virtual Machine
      |
      v
Virtual Machine.status = Pending; enqueue background job
      |
      v
job: allocate IPv6, MAC, tap name in the Frappe DB
      |
      v
upload scripts/provision-vm.sh to the server (one ssh+scp pair)
      |
      v
ssh root@server "VAR=val ... bash /tmp/atlas/provision-vm.sh"
      |  -- the script does, on the server, in one process:
      |     - cp rootfs from image dir to VM dir
      |     - truncate + resize2fs
      |     - mount, write SSH key + env, umount
      |     - write firecracker.json and network.env
      |     - systemctl enable --now firecracker-vm@<name>.service
      |  (systemd's ExecStartPost runs vm-network-up.sh)
      |
      v
Task is created with status = Running, then updated to Success
      |
      v
Virtual Machine.status = Running
```

One task per lifecycle operation. Not one task per shell command. See
[04-tasks.md](./04-tasks.md).

## What lives where

| State                          | Where                                  | Authoritative? |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Server IPs, sizes, providers   | Frappe DB                              | Yes            |
| VM specs (vCPU, RAM, disk)     | Frappe DB                              | Yes            |
| VM-to-server placement         | Frappe DB                              | Yes            |
| IPv6 address assignments       | Frappe DB                              | Yes            |
| Task history                   | Frappe DB                              | Yes            |
| Image bytes                    | Each server, `/var/lib/atlas/images/`  | No (cache)     |
| `firecracker.json`, rootfs     | Each server, `/var/lib/atlas/virtual-machines/` | No (cache) |
| systemd units                  | Each server, `/etc/systemd/system/`    | No (cache)     |
| Running Firecracker processes  | Each server                            | No (cache)     |

"No (cache)" means: if we lose it, we can rebuild it from the Frappe DB.
We do not parse it back to update Frappe.

## Why no library imports

Why not paramiko, fabric, pyinfra, python-digitalocean? Because:

- This app sits below everything else. Its dependency choices become other
  apps' dependency choices.
- Our SSH usage is "run one script, capture output." That's a `subprocess.run(["ssh", ...])`.
- DigitalOcean's API is HTTPS+JSON. Frappe already has `requests`. A few
  endpoints is fewer than a library.
- pyinfra and zx are inspirations: declarative ops that desugar to shell.
  We want the *idea* (one script per task, idempotent, structured output) —
  not a build-time dependency.

When something gets too painful, we revisit. Not before.
