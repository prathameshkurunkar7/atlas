# Images

One image for this iteration: **Ubuntu 24.04** from Firecracker CI. The image
is the (kernel, rootfs) pair referenced in the Firecracker getting-started
guide.

## Image record

A `Virtual Machine Image` document (see [02-doctypes.md](./02-doctypes.md))
holds:

- URL of the kernel binary.
- URL of the source squashfs rootfs.
- SHA-256 of each.
- Filenames the server uses to store them.
- A `default_disk_gigabytes` used when a VM doesn't override it.

Image bytes never live in the Frappe DB. They live as files on each server
and as a URL anywhere else.

## Sync to a server

One Task per server-image pair, running
[`scripts/sync-image.sh`](../scripts/sync-image.sh).

The script:

1. Ensures the kernel file exists on the server. Downloads and checksums if
   not.
2. Ensures the rootfs ext4 exists. Downloads the source squashfs,
   unsquashes it, drops in `/etc/systemd/system/atlas-network.service` and
   a placeholder `/etc/atlas-network.env`, and packs the result into an ext4
   of `default_disk_gigabytes`. Skips if the rootfs is already present.

The guest unit file [`scripts/guest/atlas-network.service`](../scripts/guest/atlas-network.service)
is uploaded to the server alongside `sync-image.sh` before the script runs.
The script's `GUEST_NETWORK_UNIT` env var points at it. Keeping the unit
file as a real file (not a heredoc inside the script) means we can lint it,
diff it, and edit it without touching shell code.

### Why we convert squashfs → ext4 server-side

We could pre-build ext4 images on our own bucket. We don't, because:

- We avoid building and storing our own artifacts for the building block.
- The Firecracker CI squashfs is public and stable for the supported
  releases.
- Conversion on the server is a few seconds, once per server per image.

When we add custom images (extra packages, custom users), we'll revisit.

## Per-VM rootfs creation

When `provision-vm.sh` runs, it:

1. Copies the pristine ext4 into the VM directory.
2. `truncate -s <disk_gigabytes>G` to grow the file.
3. `e2fsck -fy` + `resize2fs` to extend the filesystem.
4. `mount -o loop` to write `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` and
   `/etc/atlas-network.env`. The `atlas-network.service` is already in the
   pristine image and already wanted by `multi-user.target`, so we don't
   need to touch systemd inside the rootfs.
5. `umount`.

This means a freshly booted VM comes up with the right IPv6, the right SSH
key, and a working internet route within ~2 seconds of `systemctl
start`.

## Verification

Every download is checksummed against the value on the image record.
Mismatch is a hard failure of the Task. The `.part` temp file is left in
place for inspection.

## Bumping an image

To roll to a new Ubuntu CI release:

1. Update `kernel_url`, `kernel_sha256`, `rootfs_url`, `rootfs_sha256` on
   the `Virtual Machine Image`.
2. Click **Sync to All Servers**. Each server's Task downloads and rebuilds
   the ext4. The existing ext4 stays put because the script checks for
   filename presence — so old VMs continue to work from the old image bytes
   on the server.

This is intentional: bumping an image does not affect existing VMs. To put
a new VM on the new image, archive and re-provision (changing `image` is
not allowed; see [05-virtual-machine-lifecycle.md](./05-virtual-machine-lifecycle.md)).

If you want the new bits everywhere on a fresh sync, change the
`rootfs_filename` to a new value (e.g. include the release date). Then the
old file remains for old VMs, the new file gets built, and new VMs use it.
