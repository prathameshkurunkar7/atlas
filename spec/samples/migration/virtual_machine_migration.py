"""Virtual Machine Migration — the resumable phase row for a host-to-host move.

SAMPLE / ILLUSTRATIVE. See spec/19-vm-migration.md. This is the controller for
the doctype defined in virtual_machine_migration.json; the phase machine that
ADVANCES a row lives in migration.py (the scheduler callback).

The row is the source of truth for an in-flight migration (spec principle 2):
which VM, source/target servers, the current phase (`status`), the addresses,
the NBD handle, hydration progress, and any error. The scheduler re-enters the
recorded `status` each tick, so the row alone is enough to resume after a crash.
