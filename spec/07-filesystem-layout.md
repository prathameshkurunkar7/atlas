# Filesystem layout on the server

Everything Atlas puts on a server lives under `/var/lib/atlas/`. Nothing
else.

## Conventions

- Mode `0700` on `/var/lib/atlas/` and every immediate subdirectory. Root only.
- One directory per virtual machine, named by UUID. `ls virtual-machines/`
  is the inventory.
- Logs go inside the VM directory, not `/var/log/`. Easier to clean up;
  easier to ship in one tarball.
- The VM's working files — rootfs, kernel link, Firecracker config, and the
  API socket — live inside the per-VM **jail** at
  `jail/firecracker/<uuid>/root/`, owned by the VM's per-VM uid (the jailer
  chroots Firecracker there). The jail is nested under the VM directory, so
  `rm -rf` of the VM directory still takes everything with it.
- Disk snapshots live under the VM's own `snapshots/<snapshot-uuid>/` (host-
  owned, outside the jail), so terminating a VM (`rm -rf` of its directory)
  takes its snapshots with it. A snapshot is just a copy of the jail's
  `rootfs.ext4` taken while the VM is Stopped.
- The API socket is created by Firecracker inside its jail
  (`jail/.../root/run/firecracker.socket`), not under `/var/lib/atlas/run/`.
  The legacy `run/` directory is still created by bootstrap but is unused.
  Its absolute host path (~150 chars, the UUID nested twice) exceeds the
  108-byte `sun_path` limit for a Unix-domain socket address, so host tools that
  talk to it (`pause-vm.sh`, `resume-vm.sh`) `cd` into the socket's directory
  and connect via the short relative name `firecracker.socket`. Firecracker
  itself binds it as the relative `run/firecracker.socket` from inside the
  chroot, where the path is short, so the bind never hit the limit.
- Images are read-only after sync. Provisioning copies the image rootfs into
  the VM's jail; the kernel is hard-linked in (one copy, shared by inode).

## Why plain `cp` for per-VM rootfs

This iteration uses a full copy of the image rootfs per VM. Not overlayfs,
not CoW, not reflinks.

- Simple to reason about (one regular file per VM).
- Survives reboots and corruption without special handling.
- Disk overhead is bounded: ~600 MB pristine, resized up to `disk_gigabytes`.
  On `s-2vcpu-4gb-intel` (80 GB SSD) that's room for many VMs.

When density matters we will revisit. The decision is reversible — switch
to overlayfs by changing one script, no doc-type changes needed.

## What if `/var/lib/atlas/` runs out of space?

The operator gets paged (out of scope for this iteration), runs `df`, deletes
terminated VMs (they should already be cleaned by `terminate-vm.sh`), or
provisions another server. No janitor in this iteration.

## Where the Atlas helper scripts come from

The scripts under `/var/lib/atlas/bin/` are the canonical files from
[`atlas/scripts/`](../scripts/), uploaded by `Server.bootstrap()`. When we
edit a script in this repo, re-running Bootstrap on every server pushes the
new copy. The Frappe DB is the source of which version of the script *should*
be there; the file on disk is just a cache of the last bootstrap.

## Atlas-host side: SSH private keys

The Atlas host itself (the machine running the Frappe site) keeps the
SSH private key on disk under `/etc/atlas/keys/atlas.pem` (or whatever
path the operator chose). `Atlas Settings.ssh_private_key_path` stores
the path; the key body is *not* in the DB. The matching public-key body
*is* in the DB at `Atlas Settings.ssh_public_key` — providers that
upload keys at provision time (future Scaleway, AWS) read it from
there, and `Atlas Settings.ssh_fingerprint` carries the vendor-side
reference for providers that need a pre-registered fingerprint
(DigitalOcean).

One Atlas instance, one SSH key. Multi-account ("prod + staging on the
same vendor") is foreclosed by the per-vendor Single Settings model:
stand up a second Atlas site instead.

- Mode `0600` on the key file. Mode `0700` on `/etc/atlas/keys/`.
  Both owned by the Frappe user.
- Atlas reads the file at SSH-connect time via
  `secrets.get_ssh_key_from_disk(path)`. The result is held in memory
  for the duration of the SSH session and not cached.
- Rotating a key is a file-replace operation. There is no UI for
  rotation — the operator overwrites the file (or points
  `ssh_private_key_path` at a new file via a one-off `db.set_value`
  bypass; the field is `set_only_once` for the standard form flow).
- The legacy `ssh_private_key` Password column on the row is migrated
  to disk by `atlas/patches/v1_0/migrate_ssh_key_to_disk.py`. The
  patch is idempotent and writes to disk *before* clearing the DB
  reference, so a partial run is recoverable. The legacy column is
  not dropped — Frappe doesn't drop columns — it just stops being
  read by any controller.
