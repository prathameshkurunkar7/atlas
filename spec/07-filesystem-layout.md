# Filesystem layout on the server

Everything Atlas puts on a server lives under `/var/lib/atlas/`. Nothing
else.

```

## Conventions

- Mode `0700` on `/var/lib/atlas/` and every immediate subdirectory. Root only.
- One directory per virtual machine, named by UUID. `ls virtual-machines/`
  is the inventory.
- Logs go inside the VM directory, not `/var/log/`. Easier to clean up;
  easier to ship in one tarball.
- API sockets live under `/var/lib/atlas/run/`, not `/var/run/firecracker/`.
  We do not share the path with anything else.
- Images are read-only after sync. Provisioning copies the image rootfs into
  the VM directory.

## Why plain `cp` for per-VM rootfs

This iteration uses a full copy of the image rootfs per VM. Not overlayfs,
not CoW, not reflinks.

- Simple to reason about (one regular file per VM).
- Survives reboots and corruption without special handling.
- Disk overhead is bounded: ~600 MB pristine, resized up to `disk_gigabytes`.
  On `s-2vcpu-4gb-intel` (80 GB SSD) that's room for many VMs.

When density matters we will revisit. The decision is reversible — switch
to overlayfs by changing one script, no doc-type changes needed.

## What if `/var/lib/atlas/` runs out of space?

The operator gets paged (out of scope for this iteration), runs `df`, deletes
archived VMs (they should already be cleaned by `delete-vm.sh`), or
provisions another server. No janitor in this iteration.

## Where the Atlas helper scripts come from

The scripts under `/var/lib/atlas/bin/` are the canonical files from
[`atlas/scripts/`](../scripts/), uploaded by `Server.bootstrap()`. When we
edit a script in this repo, re-running Bootstrap on every server pushes the
new copy. The Frappe DB is the source of which version of the script *should*
be there; the file on disk is just a cache of the last bootstrap.
