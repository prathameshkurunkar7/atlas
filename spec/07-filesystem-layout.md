# Filesystem layout on the server

Everything Atlas puts on a server lives under `/var/lib/atlas/`. Nothing
else.

The VM disks themselves are **LVM thin volumes**, not files in this tree —
they live in the `atlas` volume group on the thin pool `pool0`, reachable at
`/dev/atlas/<name>` (base image `atlas-image-<image>`, per-VM disk
`atlas-vm-<uuid>`, disk snapshot `atlas-snap-<uuid>`). The `pool/atlas-pool.img`
sparse file is the loopback PV that group sits on.

## Conventions

- Mode `0700` on `/var/lib/atlas/` and every immediate subdirectory. Root only.
- One directory per virtual machine, named by UUID. `ls virtual-machines/`
  is the inventory.
- Logs go inside the VM directory, not `/var/log/`. Easier to clean up;
  easier to ship in one tarball.
- The VM's working files — the kernel link, Firecracker config, the API
  socket, and the `rootfs.ext4` block node — live inside the per-VM **jail** at
  `jail/firecracker/<uuid>/root/`, owned by the VM's per-VM uid (the jailer
  chroots Firecracker there). The jail is nested under the VM directory, so
  `rm -rf` of the VM directory still takes everything with it. The disk itself
  is *not* a file here: `rootfs.ext4` is a block-special node `mknod`'d to point
  at the VM's disk LV (`/dev/atlas/atlas-vm-<uuid>`), so the `rm -rf` removes the
  node but not the LV — `terminate-vm.sh` `lvremove`s the LV separately.
- Disk snapshots are **LVM thin snapshots** (`atlas-snap-<snapshot-uuid>`),
  not files under the VM directory. They live in the pool, independent of the
  VM's directory and of the origin VM disk, so terminating a VM does **not**
  take its snapshots with it — `delete-snapshot-vm.sh` `lvremove`s the snapshot
  LV explicitly. A snapshot is an instant copy-on-write `lvcreate -s` of the
  VM's disk LV, taken while the VM is Stopped (see [spec/05](./05-virtual-machine-lifecycle.md)).
- The API socket is created by Firecracker inside its jail
  (`jail/.../root/run/firecracker.socket`), not under `/var/lib/atlas/run/`.
  The legacy `run/` directory is still created by bootstrap but is unused.
  Its absolute host path (~150 chars, the UUID nested twice) exceeds the
  108-byte `sun_path` limit for a Unix-domain socket address, so host tools that
  talk to it (`pause-vm.sh`, `resume-vm.sh`) `cd` into the socket's directory
  and connect via the short relative name `firecracker.socket`. Firecracker
  itself binds it as the relative `run/firecracker.socket` from inside the
  chroot, where the path is short, so the bind never hit the limit.
- Images are read-only after sync. Sync imports the image rootfs into a
  read-only thin LV (`atlas-image-<image>`); provisioning takes an instant
  copy-on-write snapshot of it for the VM's disk. The kernel is still a plain
  file, hard-linked into the jail (one copy, shared by inode).

## Why LVM thin volumes for per-VM disks

Each VM disk is an **LVM thin snapshot of the read-only base image LV** —
`lvcreate -s`, an instant copy-on-write clone that shares the base's blocks
until the VM writes. Not a full `cp`, not overlayfs, not ext4 reflinks (ext4
has none). The base image is itself a read-only thin LV imported at sync.

- **Instant, space-thin provisioning.** A new VM disk is a metadata operation:
  no N-GB copy, near-zero extra space until the guest writes. Density is bounded
  by *written* blocks, not by VM count × image size.
- **CoW snapshots are the same primitive.** A disk snapshot is another
  `lvcreate -s` off the VM's disk LV — instant, shared blocks, and an
  independent origin (removing the base or the VM disk does not break it).
- **Thin-pool origins are independent**, so terminate can `lvremove` a VM disk
  (or even a base image) without checking for snapshots taken from it.
- **Naming derives from UUIDs**, so this needed no DocType/schema change: the VG
  is `atlas`, the pool `pool0`, devices live at `/dev/atlas/atlas-vm-<uuid>`,
  `atlas-snap-<uuid>`, `atlas-image-<image>`. The Python layer stays
  path-string oriented; the storage model lives in the shell scripts +
  [`lib/lvm.sh`](../scripts/lib/lvm.sh).

The PV under the pool is a sparse loopback file (`pool/atlas-pool.img`) on a
stock droplet's root disk — a real attached block device is the spec/09
follow-on. See [spec/08](./08-images.md) for the base-LV import and
[spec/05](./05-virtual-machine-lifecycle.md) for clone/snapshot/resize/terminate
mechanics.

## What if the thin pool runs out of space?

A thin pool over-commits: the sum of VM disk *capacities* can exceed the pool's
real size, and the pool fills as guests actually write. The host-side guard is
pool-space accounting — `snapshot-vm.sh` (and any block-allocating op) refuses
when the pool's `data_percent` or `metadata_percent` is ≥90% (read from `lvs`),
rather than `df` on a filesystem. We watch the two percentages **separately**:
metadata exhaustion is the nastier failure (it can wedge the whole pool, not
just one volume), which is why the pool is created with an explicit
`--poolmetadatasize 1G` rather than the auto-formula, which under-sizes for
snapshot-heavy use.

If the pool fills anyway despite the guard, the thin-pool `errorwhenfull`
policy is left at its LVM default: a write that can't allocate **queues for 60s
and then fails with EIO** (rather than `errorwhenfull=y`, which fails
immediately). That gives a monitoring/eviction window a chance to free space
before guests see I/O errors. We don't change this default in this iteration.
Past that, the operator gets paged (out of scope for this iteration), deletes
terminated VMs and stale snapshots, or provisions another server. Pool
autoscale / quota / GC is a spec/09 follow-on; there is no janitor in this
iteration.

## Surviving a host reboot

The pool's backing file persists across a reboot, but two pieces of state do
not, and both are reconstructed from on-disk state — never from the Frappe DB:

- **The pool.** The loop binding and the VG/pool activation are gone after a
  reboot. `atlas-pool.service` (a oneshot, ordered `Before=firecracker-vm@.service`)
  re-runs `atlas_pool_ensure`, which re-attaches the loop device and activates
  the VG with `vgchange -ay -K`. The `-K` is load-bearing: per-VM disks are
  `lvcreate -s` thin snapshots and carry the LVM **activation-skip** flag, so a
  bare `vgchange -ay` would leave every VM disk inactive. The function is also
  idempotent against LVM's *own* event-based autoactivation, which can surface
  the pool concurrently at boot — it guards the `lvcreate` on a fresh existence
  check rather than aborting.
- **Each VM's disk + jail node.** A VM disk's device-mapper minor can renumber
  across a reboot, which would dangle the `rootfs.ext4` block node mknod'd into
  the jail at provision time. Provision is not re-run on boot, so each
  `firecracker-vm@.service` runs `vm-disk-up.sh` as an `ExecStartPre`: it
  re-activates the VM's own disk LV (`-K`) and re-mknods the jail node from the
  LV's *current* major:minor (reading the per-VM uid from `network.env`). This
  is the disk analogue of `vm-network-up.sh`, and it makes an enabled VM
  self-heal its disk on every start — reboot, dm-renumber, or a manual
  `lvchange -an` all recover with no operator action.

## Where the Atlas helper scripts come from

The scripts under `/var/lib/atlas/bin/` are the canonical files from
[`atlas/scripts/`](../scripts/), uploaded by `Server.bootstrap()`. When we
edit a script in this repo, re-running Bootstrap on every server pushes the
new copy. The Frappe DB is the source of which version of the script *should*
be there; the file on disk is just a cache of the last bootstrap.

## Atlas-host side: SSH private keys

The Atlas host itself (the machine running the Frappe site) keeps the
SSH private key on disk under `/etc/atlas/keys/atlas.pem` (or whatever
path the operator chose). `Atlas Settings.ssh_private_key_path` stores
the path; the key body is *not* in the DB. The matching public-key body
*is* in the DB at `Atlas Settings.ssh_public_key` — providers that
upload keys at provision time (future Scaleway, AWS) read it from
there, and `Atlas Settings.ssh_fingerprint` carries the vendor-side
reference for providers that need a pre-registered fingerprint
(DigitalOcean).

One Atlas instance, one SSH key. Multi-account ("prod + staging on the
same vendor") is foreclosed by the per-vendor Single Settings model:
stand up a second Atlas site instead.

- Mode `0600` on the key file. Mode `0700` on `/etc/atlas/keys/`.
  Both owned by the Frappe user.
- Atlas reads the file at SSH-connect time via
  `secrets.get_ssh_key_from_disk(path)`. The result is held in memory
  for the duration of the SSH session and not cached.
- Rotating a key is a file-replace operation. There is no UI for
  rotation — the operator overwrites the file (or points
  `ssh_private_key_path` at a new file via a one-off `db.set_value`
  bypass; the field is `set_only_once` for the standard form flow).
- The legacy `ssh_private_key` Password column on the row is migrated
  to disk by `atlas/patches/v1_0/migrate_ssh_key_to_disk.py`. The
  patch is idempotent and writes to disk *before* clearing the DB
  reference, so a partial run is recoverable. The legacy column is
  not dropped — Frappe doesn't drop columns — it just stops being
  read by any controller.
