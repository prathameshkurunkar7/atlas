# Desk UI

The desk is Atlas's **operator** UI. (Users get a separate frappe-ui SPA
at `/dashboard` — see [11-user-ui.md](./11-user-ui.md).) For operators we
don't ship a custom SPA; we lean on Frappe's standard form, list, and
dialog primitives. But every Atlas form goes through a small layer of
shared client conventions so the operator sees a consistent action
hierarchy and can't fire expensive or destructive things by accident.
This section documents what that layer is and why it exists.

A second, narrower layer — scoped CSS in
[`atlas/public/css/atlas_desk.css`](../atlas/public/css/atlas_desk.css)
loaded via `app_include_css` — closes the visible gap between Atlas
and the Frappe UI / CRM / Gameplan family without touching Desk's
core CSS. Each block is documented at the call site below
(["Visual polish"](#visual-polish)); the source-of-truth audit
(token-level comparison with the Frappe UI apps, plus the list of
drifts each CSS rule addresses) is in
[`ui/audit.md`](../ui/audit.md).

## Why deviate from Frappe defaults at all

Frappe's stock form chrome — right rail (Assign / Attachments / Tags /
Share / Last Edited By), bottom Comments / Activity panel — is built
for CRM-shaped records that humans read and annotate. Atlas records are
infrastructure: an operator reads them to act, not to comment on them.
The right rail and timeline take ~50% of the screen and contribute
nothing on a Server, VM, or Task form. So we hide them, deliberately
and per-doctype, and document the decision here so a future contributor
doesn't quietly turn them back on.

We also need a button hierarchy: a desk that renders `Save`,
`Provision`, `Terminate`, `Reboot`, `Test Connection`, `Bootstrap` as
identical pills can't communicate "this one is destructive" or "this
one costs money." Frappe supports primary / secondary / danger button
variants and button groups out of the box; we just have to use them
consistently.

## The shared client surface

One file —
[`atlas/public/js/atlas_form_overrides.js`](../atlas/public/js/atlas_form_overrides.js)
— wired via `doctype_js` for the five Atlas doctypes in
[`hooks.py`](../atlas/hooks.py). It defines `frappe.atlas.*` helpers
and applies a cross-doctype `onload` / `refresh` that strips the right
rail and timeline.

### Button-tier convention

| Tier      | Helper                       | When                                                    | Style                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Primary   | `frappe.atlas.add_primary`   | The single most likely action on this form/state pair   | Top bar, `btn-primary`             |
| Secondary | `frappe.atlas.add_secondary` | Frequent siblings (Restart alongside Start / Stop)      | Top bar, default                   |
| Hidden    | `frappe.atlas.add_action`    | Rare actions (Re-bootstrap on an Active server)         | Inside the `Actions ▾` group menu  |
| Danger    | `frappe.atlas.add_danger`    | Destructive (Terminate, Reboot, Delete record)          | Inside `Actions ▾`, `btn-danger`   |

Every doctype's `refresh` calls these helpers, never the bare
`frm.add_custom_button`. The convention is the convention; deviations
should be deliberate and have a reason next to them.

#### One primary per page

Desk's own `Save` button (`.standard-actions .primary-action`) is
painted `btn-primary` on every form load, even on a clean record. With
an Atlas lifecycle hero also rendered as `btn-primary`, the page head
ends up with **two solid-black buttons** — breaking the "one primary
button per page" rule from [`llm/Taste.md`](../llm/Taste.md).

`frappe.atlas.add_primary` fixes this: after promoting the custom
button to `.btn-primary`, the helper demotes the page-head Save
(`frm.page.btn_primary`) from `.btn-primary` to `.btn-default` for the
current refresh cycle. Save keeps its click handler and Ctrl/Cmd+S
binding — only the visual weight drops, so the lifecycle action reads
as the page's single hero. On forms with no custom primary (Active
server, idle Task) `add_primary` doesn't run, so `frm.page.set_primary_action`
leaves Save solid as the page's only primary.

### Form-embedded lists — only on the workspace now

The earlier design surfaced three form-embedded `quick_list` panels
(Server > **Recent Tasks**, Task > **Sibling Tasks**, Virtual Machine
Image > **Sync Status**). All three are **gone** — Frappe's Connections
dashboard on Server / VM / Image already exposes the same Task count
and link affordance from the standard `_dashboard.py` config, and
duplicating the navigation inside the form added clutter without
adding signal.

The workspace's **Recent activity** block keeps the `quick_list`
widget (10 most recent Task rows, status pill, relative time) — that's
the operator's home, not a form section, and the at-a-glance affordance
earns its keep there.

### Confirmation helpers

```text
frappe.atlas.confirm_cost({title, body_html, proceed_label, proceed})
frappe.atlas.confirm_destructive({title, body_html, match_string,
                                  match_label, proceed_label, proceed})
```

`confirm_cost` wraps `frappe.warn` with the orange Provision-style
indicator. Used for actions that are not destructive but spend real
money, disk, or bandwidth: Provision Server (creates a billable
droplet), Clone a snapshot to a new VM (a new billable workload),
Rebuild a VM's disk, and Restore a snapshot onto its VM (both overwrite
the disk in place). Each caller supplies the latency / size hint in the
dialog body (`~90 s` to bootstrap a server, "up to a few minutes" to
copy a multi-GB rootfs). There is no Sync-to-All operator action —
image sync is automatic on image insert; see
[Virtual Machine Image](#virtual-machine-image).

`confirm_destructive` is a custom dialog with a text-match input. The
red primary button stays disabled until what the operator types
matches `match_string` exactly. Used for: Reboot a server (match the
server `title`), Terminate a VM (match the VM `title`), Delete
a Terminated VM record (match the VM `title`), Archive a Server / Image
(match the row's `title`). The dialog body is empty — typing the title
is the entire deterrent.

The match-string pattern is the same one GitHub uses for "delete
repository": the operator can't muscle-memory through it.

### Toast-and-route after every Task spawn

```text
frappe.atlas.task_started(frm, label, task_name)
```

Every controller method that returns a new Task name routes the
operator to the Task form and drops a blue toast on the source form
linking back. Latency hint copy lives inside each action's dialog
(`~90 s` for Provision Server, `~5 s` for Start, etc.) so the operator
knows what's normal.

### Chrome strip

`frappe.atlas.strip_desk_chrome(frm)`, attached to `onload` and
`refresh` for the five Atlas doctypes, hides:

- `frm.page.sidebar` — the right rail (Assign, Tags, Share, …).
- `.new-timeline`, `.comment-input-container`, `.comment-input-wrapper`,
  `.comment-input-placeholder`, `.comment-box`, `.comment-box-container`
  inside `frm.page.wrapper` — the activity panel and every known shape
  of the comment box / placeholder Frappe emits across versions.

The main column then expands from `col-lg-8` to `col-lg-12` so the
form breathes. We hide DOM nodes; we don't monkeypatch Frappe globals.

Connections dashboards (the count tiles for Workloads, Tasks, …) stay
visible — those *are* useful and Frappe renders them on the form
itself, not in the right rail.

## The workspace

The Atlas workspace is the operator's home. It is restructured around three
sections, top-to-bottom:

1. **Bootstrap checklist** — Frappe's native `Module Onboarding` widget,
   wired into the workspace `content` as a `type: "onboarding"` block.
   The four steps (Set provider_type + configure vendor Settings → Provision
   Server → Add Virtual Machine Image → Provision Virtual Machine) ship
   as
   [`module_onboarding/atlas_setup/`](../atlas/atlas/module_onboarding/atlas_setup/)
   plus four
   [`onboarding_step/<slug>/`](../atlas/atlas/onboarding_step/)
   JSON files. Each step's `reference_document` points at the target
   DocType; the operator clicks the step, lands on the create form, and
   on save the widget flips `is_complete` for that step. When all four
   are satisfied the widget collapses itself and can be permanently
   dismissed — no Atlas code, no fixture HTML/CSS/JS. The earlier
   custom-HTML implementation (`atlas-bootstrap-checklist`,
   `bootstrap_status()`) is gone. Sites bootstrapped before the
   onboarding fixture landed are migrated by
   [`atlas/patches/v1_0/migrate_workspace_to_onboarding.py`](../atlas/patches/v1_0/migrate_workspace_to_onboarding.py),
   which rewrites the workspace `content` JSON to match
   [`atlas/atlas/workspace/atlas/atlas.json`](../atlas/atlas/workspace/atlas/atlas.json)
   and force-deletes the orphaned `Custom HTML Block atlas-bootstrap-checklist`
   row if it survived. The patch is idempotent — re-running it on a
   clean site is a no-op.
2. **Fleet at a glance** — four `number_card` blocks: Active Servers,
   Running Virtual Machines, Pending Virtual Machines (tinted amber to
   draw the eye when stuck), Failed Tasks (24h) (tinted red). Frappe's
   Number Card doesn't support threshold-driven colour, so the tint is
   static; visual weight still scales with the count.
3. **Recent activity** — a `quick_list` block bound to Task. The last
   ten Task rows with their status, subject, and relative time, so the
   operator sees what the fleet is doing without leaving the workspace.

The workspace deliberately drops the "Your Shortcuts" row and the
"Reports & Masters" card section that earlier duplicated the sidebar.
The sidebar carries Home plus three collapsible groups — **Virtual**
(Virtual Machine, Virtual Machine Image), **Server** (Server, Task),
and **Settings** (Atlas Settings, DigitalOcean Settings, Self-Managed
Settings) — that *is* the right primitive for
navigation, so the workspace doesn't repeat it.

The multi-app launcher (`/desk`, `/app/home`) is *not* hidden: Frappe
short-circuits `/desk` rendering before `website_redirects` can fire
([`apps/frappe/frappe/website/path_resolver.py:34`](../../frappe/frappe/website/path_resolver.py#L34)),
so we accept a one-click cost to enter Atlas from a fresh login.
Bookmarks and the sidebar Home button hit `/app/atlas` directly.

## Visual polish

[`atlas/public/css/atlas_desk.css`](../atlas/public/css/atlas_desk.css)
is the *only* CSS Atlas adds to Desk. Every rule below was justified by
a side-by-side comparison with Frappe CRM, Gameplan, and the canonical
Frappe UI components (see [`ui/audit.md`](../ui/audit.md)). The file
is small and scoped — each block opens with a comment that points back
to the audit finding that motivated it.

### Sidebar items — inset and rounded

Desk's stock sidebar items run edge-to-edge with no hover radius. The
Frappe UI `<Sidebar>` (used by CRM and Gameplan) gives every item an
8px horizontal inset and an 8px-radius hover/active fill. Atlas
applies the same shape to `.body-sidebar .standard-sidebar-item`
(and the nested `.sidebar-child-item`). Atlas adds the 8px horizontal
inset; Frappe's stock sidebar already paints the 8px-radius hover and
active fill (and the active-state shadow) via `hover-mixin` and
`.active-sidebar` in `scss/desk/sidebar.scss`.

### Form field labels — softened to ink-gray-5

Desk's `.control-label` defaults to `--ink-gray-7` — only marginally
lighter than the value inside the input, so the eye has to decode
"label" vs "value." Frappe UI's `FormControl` paints labels
`--ink-gray-5`, clearly muted. Atlas applies the same one-line
override (`.frappe-control .control-label { color: var(--ink-gray-5); }`)
so values read louder than their labels. Section headers, modal
titles, and dialog labels are untouched — the rule is scoped to
`.frappe-control`.

### Single-tab forms with collapsible sections

Every Atlas form now collapses to a single `Overview` Tab Break with
the rest of the layout sitting under it as collapsible Section Breaks.
The earlier multi-tab shape (Networking / Host info / Activity / Image
data / Output as siblings of Overview) was scroll-light but
attention-heavy: the operator had to click across tabs to confirm one
fact. Sections under a single tab keep the same vertical density while
letting the operator skim and expand only what matters.

| Doctype | Layout |
| --- | --- |
| Server                | Overview (Identity · Networking · Host info) |
| Virtual Machine       | Overview (Identity · Resources · Networking · Security · Activity) |
| Virtual Machine Image | Overview (Identity · Image data) |
| Task                  | Overview (Status · Variables · Output) |

Dashboard panels (Operations, headlines) render above the tab strip
and remain visible regardless of which section is expanded.

### Tonal dropdown items — red and green

`frappe.atlas.add_danger` already paints destructive Actions-menu rows
with `text-danger` (red text). The CSS now also paints the whole row
`--surface-red-2` on hover, matching the frappe-ui Button
`theme=red, variant=subtle` look. A sibling helper
`frappe.atlas.add_success` does the same in green
(`--surface-green-2` on hover, `--green-800` text) for safe-but-primary
items that fold into Actions on a non-default state (e.g.
`Re-bootstrap` on an Active server).

### List empty-state polish

A filtered list with zero matches rendered top-left aligned with no
breathing room. The CSS centers `.list-view .no-result`, caps it at
420px, gives it 48px of vertical padding, and pushes the "Create a
new …" button below the message. Frappe already ships the icon and
the CTA — Atlas only adjusts the layout, no controller method needed.

### Log panes — taller stdout / stderr on Task

`Task.stdout` and `Task.stderr` are `Code` fields, which Frappe renders
as Ace editors. Desk's default pane height makes any non-trivial run a
scroll-inside-an-editor exercise. Both fields carry `"min_lines": 24`
on the schema, which Frappe's Code control forwards to Ace's
`minLines` option — the editors open ~24 lines tall by default,
matching the framework-supported height knob rather than overriding
the rendered DOM from CSS.

## Per-doctype consequences

### Atlas Settings

- Single DocType — no list view, no `name` field on the form. The
  `provider_type` Select drives `atlas.get_provider()`; switching it does not
  retro-affect existing Server rows (they keep their own `provider_type` —
  the vendor they were provisioned through). `validate()` refuses to change
  `provider_type` while a non-Archived Server carries a different one.
- **Provision Server** is the primary action — the compute-provider
  actions relocated here from the deleted Provider form.
- **Authenticate** lives under `Actions ▾`. Calls
  `provider.authenticate()` — cheap read-only ping; doesn't need
  top-bar real estate. For Self-Managed it returns
  `{ok: True, account_label: "local"}` so the chip still paints green.
- **Refresh Catalog** lives under `Actions ▾`. Calls
  `provider.discover()` and upserts `Provider Size` + `Provider Image`
  rows. Disappeared slugs flip to `enabled = 0`.
- **Discover Servers** lives under `Actions ▾`. Lists the vendor's
  servers and lets the operator adopt the ones Atlas doesn't yet model
  as `Pending` rows — see [03-bootstrapping.md § Adopting an
  already-provisioned server](./03-bootstrapping.md#adopting-an-already-provisioned-server).
- There is no **Archive** — you don't archive your only provider.
  Switching vendor is editing `provider_type` and saving; `validate()`
  refuses to change it while a non-Archived Server carries a different
  `provider_type`.
- The Provision dialog uses standard fieldtype inputs — a `title` Data
  field common to all vendor types, then:
  - **DigitalOcean**: two editable Link controls (`size` → `Provider
    Size`, `image` → `Provider Image`, both filtered to
    `provider_type=DigitalOcean, enabled=1`) defaulting to the `Provider
    Size` / `Provider Image` row marked `is_default` for the provider
    type. Region is fixed at `DigitalOcean Settings.region` and not
    shown. The dialog
    still hands off to `confirm_cost` ("Create a billable droplet?")
    before the DO API call. Monthly cost in the preview reads
    `Provider Size.monthly_cost_usd`; sizes without a cost render as
    "—" rather than guess.
  - **Self-Managed**: the four operator-supplied networking inputs.
- No auto-painted credential indicator lives on this form. Operators
  verify the token via **Authenticate** or via Test Connection on
  `DigitalOcean Settings`; both surface their result as a toast.
- The SSH-key fields are operator-supplied. `ssh_private_key_path`
  points at a `0600` PEM on the Atlas host; rotating the key is a
  file-replace operation per
  [07-filesystem-layout.md § SSH keys](./07-filesystem-layout.md), not
  a form edit. The `ssh_public_key` body is read by providers that
  upload keys at provision time; the vendor's handle for the key lives
  on the active vendor's Settings (e.g. `DigitalOcean
  Settings.ssh_key_id`), not here.

### DigitalOcean Settings

- Single DocType. Form layout mirrors the schema (api_token, region,
  ssh_key_id). The default size/image are not fields here — they live as
  `is_default` on `Provider Size` / `Provider Image`.
- **Test Connection** lives under `Actions ▾`. Calls the same
  `provider.authenticate()` path as Atlas Settings' Authenticate
  button — exposed here as a courtesy when the operator is mid-credentials.
  The result paints a toast (`OK: <account>` / `Failed: <error>`); the
  form itself stays free of auto-painted dashboard chips.
- `api_token` paints read-only after first save via `set_only_once`.
  Rotating the token: clear the field via `db.set_value`, re-enter,
  re-save. No UI gymnastics.

### Self-Managed Settings

- Single DocType. Today the form is empty — a single section break and
  no fields. No buttons. Exists so future Self-Managed-only knobs have
  a home and the registry doesn't have to special-case its absence.

### Provider Size / Provider Image

- Regular DocTypes. Operators don't create rows by hand — the **Refresh
  Catalog** button on Atlas Settings seeds them. The list view exists so the
  operator can spot-check the catalog, flip `enabled` to hide a slug from
  the Provision dialog without re-running `discover()`, and flip
  `is_default` to choose which size/image the dialog prefills (the
  controller clears the previous default on the same provider type, so
  there is always at most one).
- `provider_metadata` is a `Code` field with `read_only: 1`. The form
  renders the raw vendor JSON for debugging; operators don't edit it.

### Server

- The Server row's `name` is a UUID; the operator-facing label lives in
  the `title` field. List view, breadcrumbs, and the browser tab title
  all read `title`, not `name`. `set_only_once` freezes `title` and
  `provider_type` after the first save; the rest of the row is locked once
  written via the controller's `_validate_immutability` (which allows
  `None → value`, so the DigitalOcean provision flow can fill IPv4/6
  after insert).
- **Bootstrap** is primary when the server is `Pending` /
  `Bootstrapping` / `Broken`. On an Active server it folds under
  `Actions ▾` as **Re-bootstrap** — re-bootstrapping a healthy host
  is rare enough not to compete for top-bar real estate.
- **Sync Image** lives under `Actions ▾` on `Active` servers. It opens
  a one-field dialog (a Link to `Virtual Machine Image`, filtered to
  `is_active=1`) and calls `Server.sync_image(image)` — a thin wrapper
  around `Virtual Machine Image.sync_to_server(self.name)`.
- **Archive** lives under `Actions ▾` (hidden once the row is already
  Archived). Confirms via a type-the-title dialog, then sets
  `status = "Archived"`. The row stays in the database; existing FKs
  from Virtual Machine and Task rows continue to work.
- **Reboot** is danger. It demands the operator type the server `title`
  into a `confirm_destructive` dialog; the dialog body is empty
  (no caveat copy) — typing the title is the entire deterrent.
- There is no operator-driven "Run Task" catch-all on the form. The
  `Server.run_task_dialog` controller method is kept for
  `Task.retry`, but the desk surface only exposes scripts that are
  first-class buttons (`Bootstrap`, `Sync Image`, `Reboot`). Lifecycle
  scripts that don't earn a top-level button live on the relevant
  DocType (VM start/stop/restart on the VM form, etc.).
- **No dashboard headlines or indicator chips.** The form header
  carries only buttons; the operator opens the Task list (linked from
  the Connections dashboard's Operations panel) to see what's running.
- The bespoke **Recent Tasks** quick_list has been removed — Frappe's
  Connections dashboard panel (Operations) already exposes the
  Task count and a link to the filtered list.

### Virtual Machine

- Lifecycle buttons follow a status-keyed hierarchy:
  - `Pending` → no primary; `after_insert` already enqueued provision.
    The operator clicks `Save` and the worker takes it from there.
  - `Failed` → **Provision** primary (manual retry after an
    auto-provision failure).
  - `Stopped` → **Start** primary; **Restart** secondary; **Snapshot**,
    **Rebuild**, **Resize** under `Actions ▾` (each opens a dialog).
    These disk/size actions live only on `Stopped` because they require
    a quiesced filesystem and a pre-boot config — the controllers
    enforce it, and not painting the buttons while Running is the
    deterrent (no "click then get refused"). They sit in the Actions
    group rather than on the top bar because they're rare and deliberate
    and spend real disk + time; keeping them off the bar leaves
    Start/Restart as the visible siblings (the same tiering Server uses
    for Sync Image / Archive).
  - `Running` → **Stop** primary; **Restart** and **Pause** secondaries;
    **Snapshot (live)** and **Stop (memory snapshot)** under `Actions ▾`.
  - `Paused` → **Resume** primary; **Stop** secondary; **Snapshot (live)**
    and **Stop (memory snapshot)** under `Actions ▾`.
    **Stop (memory snapshot)** is the one-click fast stop: it posts
    `stop` with `{memory_snapshot: true}`, capturing the guest's memory so
    the next Start resumes in milliseconds — the one-off form of the per-VM
    `memory_snapshot_on_stop` flag (see
    [05 § Memory snapshots](./05-virtual-machine-lifecycle.md#memory-snapshots-fast-stop--start)).
  - `Terminated` → no lifecycle buttons; instead **Re-provision as
    new** is primary and **Delete record** is danger (under
    `Actions ▾`).
- The dialog actions use Frappe's stock `frappe.prompt` / `frappe.ui.Dialog`
  (no custom markup): **Snapshot** takes a title; **Rebuild** toggles between
  a base-image Link and an Available-snapshot Link; **Resize** prompts for
  vCPU / memory / disk (disk grow-only). Each dialog carries a muted
  latency / size hint (Snapshot copies the whole rootfs, Resize grows it
  — "up to a few minutes"). **Rebuild** additionally interposes a
  `confirm_cost` step after the source is chosen, because it overwrites
  the disk in place and can't be undone. Each posts through `frm.call`
  and routes to the resulting Task via `frappe.atlas.task_started`.
- **Terminate** is always available (until status = Terminated),
  under `Actions ▾`, danger. The `confirm_destructive` dialog body is
  empty — typing the VM's `title` into the match field is the entire
  deterrent. IPv6/Image/Server details live in the form behind the
  dialog; the dialog doesn't repeat them.
- Identity fields paint read-only after first save via the controller's
  `validate` immutability check and `set_only_once` (`title`, `server`,
  `image`, `ssh_public_key`, `size_preset`). The resource fields
  (`vcpus`, `memory_megabytes`, `disk_gigabytes`) are *not* `set_only_once`
  any more — they are editable only through the **Resize** action on a
  Stopped VM, which rewrites the on-host config in the same gesture. On the
  form they stay effectively fixed (ordinary saves of a changed value are
  rejected by `validate`); the operator changes them via the Resize dialog,
  not by typing in the field.
- **No header indicator chips.** The Networking section auto-expands
  while the VM is `Pending` so the IPv6 is visible before Provision —
  the dedicated chip is gone.
- The Security section (renamed from Access) carries an `ssh_command`
  field — a `Code` field with `is_virtual: 1` + `read_only: 1`, value
  computed by an `@property ssh_command` on the VM controller
  (`ssh root@<ipv6>`). Frappe's read-only Code control paints its own
  copy button, so we ship no markup of our own. The IPv6 is the only
  stable identifier outside the desk.
- **Terminated** records expose **Re-provision as new** (primary) and
  **Delete record** (danger) in the button row; the dashboard-headline
  banner that earlier announced "Terminated <when>" has been removed.
  **Re-provision as new** opens a new VM form with the same server /
  image / vcpus / memory / disk / ssh key and a `(clone)`-suffixed
  title pre-filled.
- The list view shows `<title> · <short id>` in the subject
  column, an IPv6 copy chip, and status-coloured indicators
  (`Pending` orange, `Running` green, `Paused` yellow,
  `Stopped`/`Terminated` grey, `Failed` red). The pills come from the
  DocType `states` array — the same mechanism Task uses — not a client
  `get_indicator`; `virtual_machine_list.js` keeps only the subject /
  IPv6 formatters and the copy-chip `onload`.
- When the linked provision Task ends in `Failure`, the
  Task.on_update hook flips the VM's `status` from `Pending`/`Running`
  to `Failed` via `frappe.db.set_value` and publishes a
  `virtual_machine_update` realtime event. The VM form subscribes and
  reloads. For `Failed` VMs the client also renders a red intro that
  links to the most recent provision-vm.py Failure Task — the
  operator clicks the link, reads the error, and clicks Provision
  again to retry.
- The **creation form** (new VM) shows one affordance on top of the
  raw schema: a `size_preset` `Select` field (Custom / Small / Medium /
  Large, each labelled with its `vCPU / MB / GB`) at the top of the
  Resources section that writes all three Int fields in one click via
  a one-line `size_preset(frm)` change handler. The earlier
  oversubscribed-server dashboard headline is gone — capacity is still
  enforced at provision time. The yellow `Description` nudge is gone —
  `reqd: 1` on `title` is the framework's native cue. When exactly one
  Active `Server` exists, the new-VM form's `server` field is
  pre-selected via a 2-row `frappe.db.get_list` lookup in `onload`.

### Virtual Machine Snapshot

- Buttons appear only on `Available` snapshots: **Clone to new VM**
  (primary), **Restore to VM** (secondary), **Delete** (danger).
- **Clone to new VM** opens a dialog for the new VM's title + SSH key
  (with a `confirm_cost`-style hint that a new billable workload is
  created, ready in ~90 s), calls `clone_to_new_vm`, and routes to the
  new VM form (which is already auto-provisioning).
- **Restore to VM** is painted only when the linked VM is `Stopped` —
  the refresh does a `frappe.db.get_value` on the VM's status and, when
  it isn't Stopped, replaces the live button with a disabled-feel
  `Actions ▾` row that names the current status and explains the VM must
  be stopped first (the same "don't paint a button you'll refuse" rule
  the VM disk actions follow, rather than confirming then hitting the
  `rebuild` Stopped-guard throw). When eligible it routes through
  `confirm_cost` (disk overwritten in place), then calls the snapshot's
  `restore_to_vm` wrapper — no cross-doc JS gymnastics — and the toast
  routes to the resulting Task.
- **Delete** uses `confirm_destructive` (type the snapshot title); deleting
  the row cascades the on-host file delete via `on_trash`.
- Snapshots are reached from the VM form's **Connections** dashboard
  ("Disk" group) and from the Snapshot list. The list paints status
  indicators (`Pending` orange, `Available` green, `Failed` red) from
  the DocType `states` array, not a client `get_indicator`.

### Virtual Machine Image

- The form is **read-only after insert** — there is no primary
  action, no Sync to Server dialog, no Sync to All Servers Actions
  item, no Sync Status panel. Image identity (URLs, checksums,
  filenames, default disk size) is immutable from creation; the
  framework's `set_only_once` paints every field read-only after the
  first save, and the controller's `_validate_immutability` raises on
  any backdoor mutation. Editing in place would silently invalidate
  prior audit rows that reference a different digest.
- **Auto-sync on insert.** `Virtual Machine Image.after_insert`
  enqueues one `sync-image.py` Task per `Active` Server. The operator
  drops kernel/rootfs URLs + checksums into the form, clicks Save,
  and the fan-out happens automatically. Tracking per-attempt happens
  through the resulting Task rows (filter the Task list by
  `script = sync-image.py`); the dedicated `Virtual Machine Image
  Sync` DocType scoped in the plan was deferred for the PoC.
- **Archive** lives under `Actions ▾`, shown only while
  `is_active = 1`. Calls the controller's `archive()` method to flip
  `is_active = 0`. Rotating an image is "create a new row, archive the
  old one" — there's no in-place upgrade.
- Ad-hoc per-server sync (e.g. catching up a freshly-Active server)
  goes through the Server form's **Sync Image** Actions item — see
  the Server section above. That dialog calls `Server.sync_image(image)`
  which delegates to `Virtual Machine Image.sync_to_server(self.name)`.

### Task

- The form is read-only (`disable_save()`).
- The list view's Status column renders a coloured pill in its own
  column (driven by the DocType's `states` JSON: `Pending` yellow,
  `Running` blue, `Success` green, `Failure` red). The previous
  Subject-cell-only indicator is gone.
- **No dashboard headlines or indicator chips.** The status pill in
  the list view's Status column, the status field on the form itself,
  and the exit code / stderr in the Output section carry the same
  signal the earlier status-coloured headline used to repeat.
- **Retry** button (primary) when status = Failure. Delegates to the
  matching VM controller method (`provision()`, `start()`,
  `terminate()`, …) for VM-scoped scripts, or to
  `Server.run_task_dialog(...)` for server-scoped scripts. The
  state-machine guards live in those methods — the Retry button does
  not duplicate them.
- **No Sibling Tasks panel.** The framework's Connections dashboard
  on the linked Server / Virtual Machine already exposes Task count
  + link; surfacing a second list inside the Task form duplicated
  navigation that's one click away.
- The `Variables (JSON)` field is **pretty-printed for read**: a
  one-shot client formatter parses `frm.doc.variables` on refresh,
  rewrites it with 2-space indent if and only if the parsed value
  round-trips, and refreshes the field without marking the form
  dirty. The stored value is untouched; only the on-screen render
  changes.
- The Output section (stdout + stderr) folds under the Overview tab
  as a collapsible Section Break rather than the old Output tab.
  Routine inspection collapses with one click; debugging expands
  inline without the tab-strip click.
- `Task.on_update` propagates status to linked records. For Failure
  with `script = provision-vm.py` it flips the linked VM's status to
  `Failed` and publishes a `virtual_machine_update` realtime event —
  the VM form re-renders without manual refresh.

## Why this isn't a custom SPA

Every win above lives in a Frappe `Dialog`, a `Module Onboarding`
widget, a `quick_list` widget, a button group, a form intro, a
dashboard indicator, a `doctype_js` client script, or one small
scoped CSS file. We don't replace the Desk form. We don't add a
route. We don't add a build step. The whole thing is Desk plus
~1.4k lines of shared client JS across the five doctype scripts +
helper module, ~200 lines of scoped CSS
([Visual polish](#visual-polish)), and a handful of whitelisted
controller methods (`provision_server`, `authenticate`,
`refresh_catalog`, `archive`, `retry`, `sync_image`,
`capacity_for_server`, …).

Anything that *looks* bespoke is borrowed: the workspace onboarding
checklist is Frappe's `Module Onboarding` doctype; the workspace
**Recent activity** block is a `quick_list` widget; the per-script
operator dialogs (Sync Image on Server) are `frappe.ui.Dialog` with
typed fields; the VM size presets are a `Select` field; the VM SSH
command is a virtual `Code` field whose value comes from a
`@property` on the controller; the Server / Virtual Machine / Snapshot /
Task list-view status pills all come from each DocType's `states` JSON
(no client `get_indicator`). The pattern: if Desk has a primitive
for it, we pass parameters to that primitive — we don't hand-roll
markup.

The two places we explicitly fight Desk are documented at the call
site: the chrome strip (right rail + timeline) on every form, and the
Task form's `disable_save()` + dashboard-headline overlay that replaces
the standard read-only field-list affordance with a status-coloured
headline + collapsible Output section. Both are intentional; both are
reversible by removing one client script.
