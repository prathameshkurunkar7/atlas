# DocTypes

Twenty DocTypes. Module `Atlas`. None are submittable. All track changes.
Read permission for `System Manager`.

1. [Atlas Settings](#atlas-settings) — vendor-agnostic Atlas config (Single).
2. [Provider](#provider) — one row per configured vendor.
3. [DigitalOcean Settings](#digitalocean-settings) — DO API config (Single).
4. [Self-Managed Settings](#self-managed-settings) — Self-Managed config (Single).
5. [Provider Size](#provider-size) — vendor catalog of machine sizes.
6. [Provider Image](#provider-image) — vendor catalog of OS images.
7. [Server](#server)
8. [Virtual Machine](#virtual-machine)
9. [Virtual Machine Image](#virtual-machine-image)
10. [Virtual Machine Snapshot](#virtual-machine-snapshot) — a disk snapshot of a VM.
11. [Reserved IP](#reserved-ip) — a public IPv4 allocated to a Server, optionally attached to a VM.
12. [Subdomain](#subdomain) — a `<subdomain>.<region>.frappe.dev` routing entry pointing at a site VM.
13. [SSH Key](#ssh-key) — a user's public key, chosen when creating a VM.
14. [Task](#task)
15. [Domain Provider](#domain-provider) — one row per configured DNS vendor (DNS-01).
16. [Route53 Settings](#route53-settings) — AWS Route 53 API config (Single).
17. [TLS Provider](#tls-provider) — one row per configured certificate issuer.
18. [Lets Encrypt Settings](#lets-encrypt-settings) — ACME account config (Single).
19. [Root Domain](#root-domain) — one wildcard zone == one region.
20. [TLS Certificate](#tls-certificate) — the issued regional wildcard cert.

The first six form the **Provider abstraction**: a single ABC in
`atlas/atlas/providers/base.py` with one implementation per
`Provider.provider_type`. Every vendor call goes through that interface;
controllers never branch on `provider_type`. See
[provider-abstraction.md](../llm/plan/provider-abstraction.md) for the
implementation plan.

DocTypes 15–20 form the **TLS & Domain layer** ([13-tls.md](./13-tls.md)) — the
producer for the proxy's `push_cert`. They mirror the Provider shape with two
more registries: `atlas/atlas/dns/` (a `DnsProvider` ABC per `Domain
Provider.provider_type`) and `atlas/atlas/tls/` (a `TlsProvider` ABC per `TLS
Provider.provider_type`). Same rule: controllers resolve an implementation by
name and never branch on the vendor type.

Each DocType is specified by three sections: **Fields** (the schema), **Form
layout** (the section/column structure of the desk form), and **List view**
(column order and standard filters). Together these are enough to
regenerate the JSON without consulting the implementation.

Notation in the Form layout sections:

- `── <label> ──` is a Section Break with that label.
- `(collapsible)` after a section label means the section is collapsed by
  default.
- `|` is a Column Break inside a section. Fields after `|` lay out in the
  next column.

## Atlas Settings

A Single DocType. Holds Atlas-wide configuration that is not vendor-specific:
which `Provider` is currently active, and the operator's SSH key (fingerprint,
public-key body, on-disk path). Every `get_provider()` call in the codebase
reads `Atlas Settings.provider` to pick the implementation — this is the
indirection layer.

### Fields

| Field                  | Type             | Reqd | Notes                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `provider`             | Link → Provider  | Y    | The currently-active Provider row. `atlas.get_provider()` reads this. |
| `default_user_image`   | Link → Virtual Machine Image | | Base image a dashboard user's new machine provisions from when they don't pick one. Disambiguates placement when several images are active. See [11-user-ui.md](./11-user-ui.md). |
| `overprovision_factor` | Float            |      | Fleet-wide vCPU oversubscription multiplier (default `1`). A host's *effective* vCPU budget — what `default_server` placement and the desk capacity helper check against — is its physical vCPU total times this factor. `1` means no oversubscription. Safe to raise because a VM's `vcpus` is a `cpu.max` *bandwidth* cap, not a pinned core. A host whose size has no known vCPU total (uncatalogued slug or self-managed) is unaffected — it always counts as having room. See [server_capacity.py](../atlas/atlas/api/server_capacity.py) and `placement.py`. |
| `ssh_key_id`           | Data             |      | Vendor's handle for the uploaded SSH key, when the vendor needs one (DigitalOcean). Passed through to the provider as `SshKey.vendor_id`; format is vendor-specific (DO accepts the key's numeric id or its SHA-256 fingerprint). |
| `ssh_public_key`       | Long Text        |      | OpenSSH public key body. Crosses the provider interface for vendors that upload at provision time. Not required for DO. |
| `ssh_private_key_path` | Data             | Y    | Absolute path on the Atlas host where the matching private key lives. Atlas reads the PEM at SSH-connect time via `secrets.get_ssh_key_from_disk(path)`. `0600`, owned by the Frappe user. |

Why one Single instead of fields on each `Provider` row: the SSH key, the
active provider, and any other cross-vendor switch are properties of the
Atlas instance, not of a vendor. Routing reads through a single helper
also lets the storage backend swap to an external secret store later
without touching callers.

### Form layout

```
── Active provider ──
provider
── User dashboard ──
default_user_image
── Capacity ──
overprovision_factor
── SSH key ──
ssh_key_id
ssh_public_key
| ssh_private_key_path
```

### Buttons

None. The form saves on edit and `atlas.get_provider()` picks up the new
value on the next call. Switching the active provider does not destroy
any existing Server rows — they keep their `provider` FK pointing at
whatever they were provisioned through.

---

## Provider

One row per configured vendor. Thin link table — no credentials, no
defaults. Vendor-specific configuration lives on the per-vendor Single
Settings DocType (e.g. `DigitalOcean Settings`).

`Server.provider` is a Link → Provider, frozen on first save.

### Fields

| Field           | Type   | Reqd | Default | Notes                                                              |
| --------------- | ------ | ---- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `provider_name` | Data   | Y    |         | Primary key. Unique. `set_only_once`. e.g. `digitalocean-production`, `home-lab`. |
| `provider_type` | Select | Y    |         | Options: `DigitalOcean`, `Self-Managed`. `set_only_once`. The provider registry (`atlas/atlas/providers/__init__.py`) keys off this value to pick the implementation class. |
| `is_active`     | Check  |      | 1       | Flipped to 0 via the `archive()` controller method. `get_provider()` refuses to instantiate an archived row. |

### Form layout

```
provider_name
provider_type
| is_active
```

### List view

- Columns: `provider_name`, `provider_type`, `is_active`.
- Standard filters: `provider_type`, `is_active`.

### Buttons

- **Provision Server** (primary) — opens a dialog. Common field:
  `title` (lowercase + digits + hyphens, max 63 chars; passed through
  to the vendor as the server's name and tag). The remaining inputs
  are produced by the provider implementation's `discover()`-backed
  dialog schema:
  - **DigitalOcean**: `size` (Link → Provider Size, filtered to
    `provider_type=DigitalOcean, enabled=1`), `image` (Link → Provider
    Image, same filter), defaulting to `DigitalOcean Settings.default_size`
    / `default_image`. Then `confirm_cost` ("Create a billable
    droplet?") before the DO API call.
  - **Self-Managed**: `ipv4_address`, `ipv6_address`, `ipv6_prefix`,
    `ipv6_virtual_machine_range`. Atlas inserts the `Server` directly
    with the operator-supplied values and runs bootstrap. No API call.
  The whitelisted `provision_server(title, ...)` controller method
  returns the new Server row's UUID `name`. See
  [03-bootstrapping.md](./03-bootstrapping.md).
- **Authenticate** — under `Actions ▾`. Calls `provider.authenticate()`,
  which probes the vendor (DigitalOcean: `GET /account`) and reports
  back account label, rate-limit headers, and `missing_scopes`. Hidden
  for vendors without remote credentials (Self-Managed returns
  `ok=True, account_label="local"` so the form still paints a green
  chip on refresh).
- **Refresh Catalog** — under `Actions ▾`. Calls `provider.discover()`
  and upserts `Provider Size` and `Provider Image` rows. Slugs the
  vendor no longer returns are flipped to `enabled=0`; historical
  Server rows keep their Link.
- **Archive** — `Actions ▾`, shown only when `is_active = 1`. Calls
  `archive()` which flips `is_active = 0` via `db.set_value`. Existing
  Servers keep their FK reference so historical Tasks stay queryable.

The Provider form has no auto-painted credential indicator; the
operator clicks **Authenticate** when they need to verify.

---

## DigitalOcean Settings

A Single DocType. Only fields that DigitalOcean's API needs.

### Fields

| Field           | Type                  | Reqd | Notes                                                              |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `api_token`     | Password              | Y    | `set_only_once`. DigitalOcean personal access token. Rotate by clearing the field via `db.set_value`, then re-saving. |
| `region`        | Data                  | Y    | DO is multi-region; Atlas is single-region. Pick one (`blr1`, `nyc3`, …). `provision_server` throws if the dialog overrides this. |
| `default_size`  | Link → Provider Size  | Y    | Filtered to `provider_type=DigitalOcean, enabled=1`. Default selection in the Provision dialog. |
| `default_image` | Link → Provider Image | Y    | Same filter as `default_size`.                                     |

### Form layout

```
api_token
region
── Defaults for new servers ──
default_size
| default_image
```

### Buttons

- **Test Connection** — under `Actions ▾`. Calls
  `DigitalOceanProvider.authenticate()` (same as the Provider form's
  Authenticate button, mirrored here for the operator who's mid-credentials).
  Result surfaces via a toast (`OK: <account>` / `Failed: <error>`);
  there is no auto-painted dashboard indicator.

Monthly cost preview for the Provision dialog reads `Provider Size.monthly_cost_usd`
directly. Sizes without a cost render as "—" rather than guess.

---

## Self-Managed Settings

A Single DocType. Empty stub today — Self-Managed has no vendor-side
configuration (everything Atlas needs for a Self-Managed host lives in
`Atlas Settings` plus the operator-supplied IPs at provision time).
The DocType exists so future Self-Managed-only knobs have a home; the
form ships with a single section break and no fields.

---

## Provider Size

A regular DocType. One row per vendor-advertised machine size that Atlas
is willing to provision. Seeded at first run by `bootstrap.py` and
refreshed via the Provider form's **Refresh Catalog** button (which
calls `provider.discover()`).

### Fields

| Field               | Type   | Reqd | Read-only | Default | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------ | ---- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`              | Data   | Y    | Y         |         | Primary key. Format: `{provider_type}/{slug}` (e.g. `DigitalOcean/s-2vcpu-4gb-intel`). Assigned in `autoname()`. |
| `provider_type`     | Select | Y    |           |         | Same options as `Provider.provider_type`. `set_only_once`.         |
| `slug`              | Data   | Y    |           |         | Vendor-native slug — the string sent on the API wire (`s-2vcpu-4gb-intel`). `set_only_once`. |
| `enabled`           | Check  |      |           | 1       | Flipped by `discover()` when the vendor drops a slug. Disabled rows do not appear in the Provision dialog but remain pointable from historical Server rows. |
| `monthly_cost_usd`  | Int    |      |           |         | Hand-maintained for vendors without per-size pricing in the API (DO). Renders as "—" when blank. |
| `provider_metadata` | Code (JSON) |  | Y      |         | Raw vendor response for this size — vCPU count, RAM, disk tier, anything the vendor returns. Read-only on the form. |

### List view

- Columns: `slug`, `provider_type`, `enabled`, `monthly_cost_usd`.
- Standard filters: `provider_type`, `enabled`.

---

## Provider Image

A regular DocType. One row per vendor-advertised OS image that Atlas is
willing to provision a server with. Same lifecycle as `Provider Size`.

Distinct from `Virtual Machine Image`: this is the *server's* base image
(the OS Atlas bootstraps on top of), not the guest rootfs+kernel pair
that runs inside a Firecracker microVM.

### Fields

| Field               | Type   | Reqd | Read-only | Default | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------ | ---- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`              | Data   | Y    | Y         |         | Primary key. Format: `{provider_type}/{slug}` (e.g. `DigitalOcean/ubuntu-24-04-x64`). |
| `provider_type`     | Select | Y    |           |         | `set_only_once`.                                                   |
| `slug`              | Data   | Y    |           |         | Vendor-native slug (DO `ubuntu-24-04-x64`, future AWS `ami-…`). `set_only_once`. |
| `enabled`           | Check  |      |           | 1       | Flipped by `discover()`.                                           |
| `provider_metadata` | Code (JSON) |  | Y      |         | Raw vendor response — architecture, distribution, release date, …  |

### List view

- Columns: `slug`, `provider_type`, `enabled`.
- Standard filters: `provider_type`, `enabled`.

---

## Server

One row per host. The primary key is a UUID assigned at insert; the
operator-facing label lives in `title` (e.g. `server-blr1-01`).

### Fields

| Field                          | Type                  | Reqd | Read-only | Default | Notes                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ---- | --------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                         | UUID (autoname)       | Y    | Y         |         | Primary key. UUID minted in `Server.autoname()`. Stable for the row's lifetime; no rename UI. |
| `title`                        | Data                  | Y    |           |         | Operator-chosen label. `set_only_once` — first save freezes it. |
| `provider`                     | Link → Provider       | Y    |           |         | `set_only_once`. |
| `status`                       | Select                | Y    | Y         | Pending | `Pending`, `Bootstrapping`, `Active`, `Draining`, `Broken`, `Archived`. Controllers mutate via `db.set_value`. |
| `provider_resource_id`         | Data                  |      | Y         |         | Vendor's primary key for this host (DigitalOcean droplet id, future AWS instance id, …). Empty for `Self-Managed`. Locked once written. |
| `size`                         | Link → Provider Size  |      | Y         |         | Populated by `provider.describe()` after provision. Empty for `Self-Managed`. |
| `image`                        | Link → Provider Image |      | Y         |         | Server's base OS image. Populated by `provider.describe()`. Empty for `Self-Managed`. |
| `ipv4_address`                 | Data                  |      | Y         |         | The SSH endpoint. Set by `provider.describe()` (DigitalOcean) or by the operator at provision time (Self-Managed). Locked once written. |
| `ipv6_address`                 | Data                  |      | Y         |         | The server's own IPv6. Whatever the host actually answers on. |
| `ipv6_prefix`                  | Data                  |      | Y         |         | The full prefix routed to this server (typically a /64). Informational. |
| `ipv6_virtual_machine_range`   | Data                  |      | Y         |         | The subnet Atlas allocates VM addresses from. Any prefix length: `/64`, `/80`, `/124`, ... Produced by `provider.describe()`. For `DigitalOcean` it's the /124 carved from the /64 (see [06-networking.md](./06-networking.md)); for `Self-Managed` it's the operator-typed value. |
| `provider_metadata`            | Code (JSON)           |      | Y         |         | Raw vendor blob returned by `describe()`. Holds anything the vendor reports that doesn't have a named column (DigitalOcean `created_at`, future AWS placement group, …). Forward-compatibility seam — read-only. |
| `architecture`                 | Data                  |      | Y         |         | Set by bootstrap. Allowed to change on re-bootstrap. |
| `firecracker_version`          | Data                  |      | Y         |         | Set by bootstrap. Allowed to change on re-bootstrap. |
| `jailer_version`               | Data                  |      | Y         |         | Set by bootstrap. Allowed to change on re-bootstrap. |
| `kernel_version`               | Data                  |      | Y         |         | Set by bootstrap. Allowed to change on re-bootstrap. |

Atlas is single-region: there is no `Server.region` column. A vendor
that operates in multiple regions stores its operating region on its
own Settings Single (e.g. `DigitalOcean Settings.region`), and one
Atlas instance pins one region per vendor.

Immutability is enforced by `Server._validate_immutability()` (lock
once a value is written; allow `None → value` so `finish_provisioning`
can write the IPs, size, image, and `provider_metadata` onto a freshly
inserted Pending row). The framework `set_only_once` flag covers
`title` and `provider` because those are populated at insert time and
never legitimately change.

### Controller methods

- `archive()` — calls `provider.destroy(provider_resource_id)` first
  (no-op for Self-Managed, releases the droplet for DigitalOcean), then
  sets `status = "Archived"` via `db.set_value`. Idempotent (rejects
  if already Archived). Existing FKs from Virtual Machine and Task rows
  are preserved.
- `sync_image(image)` — single-server convenience wrapper around
  `Virtual Machine Image.sync_to_server(self.name)`. Used by the
  Server form's Sync Image action.
- `bootstrap()` / `reboot()` / `get_scripts()` / `run_task_dialog(...)`
  — Task-running entry points; see [04-tasks.md](./04-tasks.md).

The split between `ipv6_prefix` and `ipv6_virtual_machine_range` is
because on DigitalOcean a /64 is advertised but only the first /124 is
actually routable; we hand out addresses inside that /124 only. On
Self-Managed hosts the operator might have an entire extra /64 (or /80,
or /48) routed to the box and so the VM range can be much larger than
/124. Atlas treats `ipv6_virtual_machine_range` as "the subnet I am
allowed to allocate from" and does not try to derive it. Details in
[06-networking.md](./06-networking.md).

### Form layout

Single `Overview` tab. Networking / Host info / Notes are collapsible
sections, not separate tabs.

```
── Overview ──

```

### List view

- Columns (left to right): `title`, `provider`, `status`, `size`,
  `ipv4_address`.
- Standard filters: `provider`, `status`, `size`.

### Buttons

- **Bootstrap** (primary on `Pending` / `Bootstrapping` / `Broken`;
  folds under `Actions ▾` as **Re-bootstrap** on `Active`) — runs
  [`scripts/bootstrap-server.py`](../scripts/bootstrap-server.py).
  Idempotent.
- **Sync Image** (under `Actions ▾`, on `Active`) — opens a one-field
  dialog (Link to `Virtual Machine Image`) and calls
  `Server.sync_image(image)`. There is no operator-driven "Run Task"
  catch-all on the form; lifecycle scripts that aren't a first-class
  button live on the relevant DocType (VM start/stop on the VM form,
  etc.). The `run_task_dialog` controller method is kept for
  `Task.retry` only.
- **Archive** (under `Actions ▾`, on non-`Archived` rows, danger) —
  confirms via a type-the-title dialog. Calls
  `provider.destroy(provider_resource_id)` first (releases the
  DigitalOcean droplet; no-op for Self-Managed), then sets
  `status = "Archived"`. Archive is the destroy trigger — there is no
  separate Destroy button. The dialog body warns that the vendor
  resource will be released.
- **Reboot** (under `Actions ▾`, danger) — runs
  [`scripts/reboot-server.sh`](../scripts/reboot-server.sh)
  (`systemctl reboot` over SSH). The resulting Task may end in `Failure`
  (SSH drops before the script returns) or `Success` (`systemctl reboot`
  exits before the connection is torn down). Either outcome is normal; the
  meaning is "the server is rebooting." Operators confirm reboot by
  watching for SSH to come back, not by reading the Task status. The
  desk requires the operator to type the server title into a
  text-match dialog before the red button enables — see
  [10-desk-ui.md](./10-desk-ui.md).

Frappe's standard Connections dashboard renders below the form, linking
Virtual Machines and Tasks (under **Operations**) and the Server's
[Reserved IP](#reserved-ip) pool (under **Networking**) via their `server`
field (configured in `server_dashboard.py`). The desk's bespoke "Recent Tasks"
quick_list has been removed — Operations on the Connections dashboard already
exposes the same information.

A Server's **Reserved IP pool** is the set of `Reserved IP` rows whose `server`
is this host — public IPv4 addresses bound to the host (DigitalOcean reserved
IPs), each either unattached (`Allocated`) or attached to one of this Server's
VMs (`Attached`). The host's own SSH endpoint is the separate `ipv4_address`
field above; a Reserved IP is an *additional*, attachable address, not the
host's primary v4.

---

## Virtual Machine

One row per microVM. The primary key is a UUID assigned at insert and never
changes — not even on terminate. Predictable, stable identity that survives
deletion.

### Fields

Whole number ≥ 1 (a guest can't boot on a fractional thread count); it is also what server-capacity accounting sums for the thread budget. CPU *bandwidth* below or at one core is set by `cpu_max_cores`, not here. Frozen on ordinary saves; mutable via `resize()` on a Stopped VM. No `set_only_once` (the controller is the gate). |
| `cpu_max_cores`    | Float                         | Y    |           | 1       | cgroup `cpu.max` bandwidth cap in whole-core units (see [networking.cgroup_args](../atlas/atlas/networking.py)). Fractional for sub-1 sizes: `0.0625` is 1/16 of a core. Defaults to `vcpus` (whole-core behavior) when a caller sets only `vcpus` — the operator desk path, the bootstrap seed, direct API. The size presets ([sizes.py](../atlas/atlas/sizes.py)) set both. Same resize rule as `vcpus`; the bandwidth cap is baked into the per-VM jailer launcher at provision time, so a changed cap takes effect on re-provision (see [05 § Resize](./05-virtual-machine-lifecycle.md#resize)). |

The operator unchecks and saves before stopping — a deliberate two-step guard, the same shape as the immutability throws. Independent of `termination_protection`. |
| `termination_protection` | Check                   |      |           | 0       | When set, `terminate()` refuses to terminate the VM. Off by default. Unchecked + saved before terminate. Independent of `stop_protection` (terminate does not go through `stop()`). |

Empty until one is attached. Maintained by `Reserved IP.attach()` / `detach()` (and cleared on terminate); never hand-edited. See [Reserved IP](#reserved-ip) and [06-networking.md](./06-networking.md). |

A proxy VM fronts a region's [Subdomain](#subdomain)s and is reconciled by the proxy control plane. It is an *ordinary* operator-owned VM (no infra tier) running the proxy image with an attached `public_ipv4`. See [12-proxy.md](./12-proxy.md). |
| `region`           | Data                          |      |           |         | The region whose subdomains this proxy serves (`depends_on: is_proxy`). Every proxy VM in a region serves the full set of active subdomains for that region. |
| `last_started`     | Datetime                      |      | Y         |         |                                                                  |
| `last_stopped`     | Datetime                      |      | Y         |         |                                                                  |

Because the name is a UUID, the operator needs `title` to recognize a
VM in lists. The framework's `title_field` points at it; the browser
tab, breadcrumb, and list-view subject all read `title`.

`status` is read-only on the form because it is only ever set by lifecycle
methods (Provision/Start/Stop/Restart/Terminate); see
[05-virtual-machine-lifecycle.md](./05-virtual-machine-lifecycle.md).

`ssh_public_key` is the key injected into the *guest's*
`/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` — it is how the operator SSHes into the
VM, not into the host. The host key lives on `Atlas Settings`
(`ssh_key_id`, `ssh_public_key`, `ssh_private_key_path`).

### Auto-provision contract

`Virtual Machine.after_insert` enqueues
`atlas.atlas.doctype.virtual_machine.virtual_machine.auto_provision`
on the `long` queue; the worker resolves the VM by name, checks
`status == "Pending"`, and calls `provision()`. The operator clicks
**Save**, not **Provision** — the form's Pending state no longer
carries a primary action. A failed auto-provision flips the VM to
`Failed`, at which point the form's **Provision** primary returns as
a retry. See [05-virtual-machine-lifecycle.md](./05-virtual-machine-lifecycle.md).

### Form layout

A single `Overview` Tab Break with the rest as collapsible Section

### List view

- Columns (left to right): `title`, `server`, `image`, `status`,
  `ipv6_address`.
- Standard filters: `server`, `image`, `status`.

### Buttons

Tiering is keyed off `status` — see [10-desk-ui.md § Virtual Machine](./10-desk-ui.md#virtual-machine):

- **Pending** — no primary; `after_insert` already enqueued provision.
- **Provision** (primary on `Failed`) — manual retry after an
  auto-provision failure. Runs
  [`scripts/provision-vm.py`](../scripts/provision-vm.py).
- **Start** (primary on `Stopped`) — `Stopped` → `Running`.
- **Stop** (primary on `Running`) — `Running` → `Stopped`. Also offered
  (secondary) on `Paused`. Refused while `stop_protection` is set (the
  controller throws; the operator unchecks + saves first).
- **Resume** (primary on `Paused`) — `Paused` → `Running`.
- **Restart** (secondary on `Stopped` / `Running`) → `Running`.
- **Pause** (secondary on `Running`) — `Running` → `Paused` via the API
  socket. Runs [`scripts/pause-vm.py`](../scripts/pause-vm.py).
- **Snapshot / Rebuild / Resize** (secondaries on `Stopped`, each opens a
  dialog) — disk and size operations; see
  [05-virtual-machine-lifecycle.md](./05-virtual-machine-lifecycle.md). They
  appear only while Stopped, which is the deterrent against resizing or
  snapshotting a live VM (the controllers also enforce it). The Snapshot
  dialog's name is optional and pre-filled with `<vm title> — <timestamp>`;
  `snapshot(title)` defaults to the same when `title` is omitted, so a caller
  need not invent a name.
- **Terminate** (under `Actions ▾`, danger; available until
  `Terminated`) — runs
  [`scripts/terminate-vm.py`](../scripts/terminate-vm.py), sets
  `status = Terminated`, detaches the VM's `Reserved IP` (if any) back to the
  Server pool, and deletes the VM's snapshot rows. The UUID does not change.
  Refused while `termination_protection` is set (the controller throws). The
  desk requires the operator to type the VM's `title` into a
  `confirm_destructive` dialog before the red button enables; the dialog body
  is empty — typing the title is the entire deterrent.

## Virtual Machine Snapshot

A disk snapshot of one VM — a copy of its `rootfs.ext4` at a point in time.
Not a Firecracker memory-state snapshot. Created from a Stopped VM; the bytes
live on the same server as the VM, under
`/var/lib/atlas/virtual-machines/<vm-uuid>/snapshots/<snapshot-uuid>/`.

### List view

- Columns: `title`, `virtual_machine`, `status`.
- Standard filters: `virtual_machine`, `status`, `server`.

### Controller methods

- `restore_to_vm()` — restore this snapshot onto its own VM (rollback in
  place). Thin wrapper around `Virtual Machine.rebuild("snapshot", self.name)`
  so the Stopped-state guard lives in one place. Returns the Task name.
- `clone_to_new_vm(title, ssh_public_key, vcpus?, memory_megabytes?,
  disk_gigabytes?)` — create a new VM seeded from this snapshot (fresh
  identity). Disk defaults to the snapshot's size and can only grow.
- `on_trash` — runs [`delete-snapshot-vm.py`](../scripts/delete-snapshot-vm.py)
  to delete the on-host files, skipped when the VM is already Terminated
  (its directory is gone).

### Buttons

Shown only on `Available` snapshots:

- **Clone to new VM** (primary) — dialog for new title + SSH key; creates a
  fresh VM and routes to it.
- **Restore to VM** (secondary) — confirm, then `restore_to_vm()`. The VM
  must be Stopped (the underlying `rebuild` enforces it).
- **Delete** (danger) — `confirm_destructive`; deletes the row, which
  cascades the on-host file delete.

## Virtual Machine Image

A kernel + rootfs pair, identified by a name.

### Fields

| Field                    | Type   | Reqd | Read-only | Default | Notes                                                |

| `image_name`             | Data   | Y    |           |         | Primary key. Unique. `set_only_once`. e.g. `ubuntu-24.04`. |
| `title`                  | Data   |      |           |         | Operator-chosen label; `title_field` for the form. `set_only_once`. |
| `is_active`              | Check  |      |           | 1       |                                                      |
| `default_disk_gigabytes` | Int    | Y    |           | 4       | `set_only_once`. Size of the pristine ext4 (per-VM disk grows from this). |
| `kernel_url`             | Data   | Y    |           |         | `set_only_once`. HTTPS URL of the uncompressed `vmlinux`. |
| `kernel_filename`        | Data   | Y    |           |         | `set_only_once`. Filename on the server.             |
| `kernel_sha256`          | Data   | Y    |           |         | `set_only_once`. Hex digest of the kernel.           |
| `rootfs_url`             | Data   | Y    |           |         | `set_only_once`. HTTPS URL of the source squashfs.   |
| `rootfs_filename`        | Data   | Y    |           |         | `set_only_once`. Filename of the resulting ext4 on the server. |
| `rootfs_sha256`          | Data   | Y    |           |         | `set_only_once`. Hex digest of the source squashfs.  |

Every non-`is_active` field is immutable from `after_insert` onward —
the framework `set_only_once` flag paints them read-only on the form,
and the controller's `_validate_immutability` is the
defense-in-depth check.

### Form layout

A single `Overview` Tab Break with the image-data fields under a
collapsible Section Break:

```
image_name
title
| is_active
  default_disk_gigabytes
── Image data ── (collapsible)
kernel_url
kernel_filename
| kernel_sha256
rootfs_url
rootfs_filename
| rootfs_sha256
```

### List view

- Columns (left to right): `name` (the `image_name` autoname),
  `title`, `default_disk_gigabytes`, `is_active`. The legacy
  `image_name` column is dropped from `in_list_view` — the framework
  always renders the autoname as the ID column, so an extra
  `image_name` column was redundant.
- Standard filters: `is_active`.

A first-time operator does not need to invent any of these values. The
Ubuntu 24.04 cloud image constants live in
[`atlas/bootstrap.py`](../atlas/bootstrap.py) as `DEFAULT_IMAGE` (server)
and `MINIMAL_IMAGE` (minimal), mirrored in
[`atlas/tests/e2e/_config.py`](../atlas/tests/e2e/_config.py). Copy one
into the form, or run `atlas.bootstrap.run` which inserts the server row
for you. See [08-images.md](./08-images.md).

### Auto-sync contract

`Virtual Machine Image.after_insert` fans out to every `Server` with
`status = Active`: for each one it calls `self.sync_to_server(server)`,
which enqueues a `sync-image.py` Task. The operator does *not* press
**Sync to Server** for the initial fan-out — saving the image is the
trigger. Per-attempt tracking happens via the resulting Task rows
(filter the Task list by `script = sync-image.py`); a dedicated
`Virtual Machine Image Sync` tracking DocType was scoped in the plan
but deferred for the PoC.

The `sync_to_server` and `sync_to_all_servers` whitelisted methods
survive for use by `bootstrap.py` and the e2e harness, but no
operator-facing buttons surface them — the form is effectively
read-only after creation, and the field lock is enforced by both
`set_only_once` and `_validate_immutability`.

### Buttons

- **Archive** (under `Actions ▾`, shown only while `is_active = 1`).
  Calls `archive()` to flip `is_active = 0`. Idempotent.

No primary action, no Sync Status panel, no Sync-to-Server picker on
the form. Initial sync is automatic on save; ad-hoc per-server sync
goes through **Sync Image** on the target Server's `Actions ▾` menu.

## Reserved IP

A public IPv4 address that belongs to a `Server` and may be attached to one of
that Server's VMs. The address is the unit of allocation: it is **allocated to
the Server** (the vendor binds a reserved IP to the droplet — see
[06-networking.md](./06-networking.md)) and exists whether or not a VM is using
it. Attaching it to a VM is a separate, reversible step.

This is what makes a VM reachable on IPv4. Atlas VMs are otherwise
inbound-IPv6-only (`spec/06`: one public `/128`, IPv4 egress-only via host
NAT44). A Reserved IP, attached to a VM and 1:1-NATed by the host to the guest's
private `/30`, gives that one VM inbound IPv4. Today this is used by the reverse
proxy (an operator-owned VM); the same mechanism generalizes to tenant VMs
later.

A Server owns a **pool** of Reserved IPs: the set of `Reserved IP` rows whose
`server` points at it. There is no child-grid embedding — like
`Virtual Machine Snapshot`, a Reserved IP is a standalone DocType linked to its
Server (and surfaced in the Server's Connections dashboard), so it has its own
allocate/attach/detach/release lifecycle and is independently queryable
("which VM has this IP?", "is there a free IP on this Server?").

### Fields

| Field                  | Type                  | Reqd | Read-only | Default   | Notes                                                            |

| `name`                 | UUID (autoname `hash`) | Y   | Y         |           | Primary key. |
| `ip_address`           | Data                  | Y    | Y         |           | The public IPv4. `unique`. `title_field`. Locked once written. |
| `server`               | Link → Server         | Y    | Y         |           | The host this IP is allocated to. The IP belongs to the Server even with no VM attached. Locked once written. |
| `status`               | Select                | Y    | Y         | Allocated | `Allocated` (on the Server, no VM) or `Attached` (bound to a VM). Derived in `validate()` from `virtual_machine` — never set by hand. |
| `virtual_machine`      | Link → Virtual Machine |     | Y         |           | The attached VM, or empty when unattached. Only a VM on the **same Server** may be attached. Maintained by `attach()` / `detach()`. |
| `provider_resource_id` | Data                  |      | Y         |           | Vendor's handle for the reserved IP (DigitalOcean reserved-IP id). Empty for Self-Managed. Locked once written. |

Immutability follows the `Server` idiom: `ip_address`, `server`, and
`provider_resource_id` lock once they carry a value (`None → value` allowed for
initial population). `status` is always derived from `virtual_machine`, so it is
never an independent input.

### Controller methods

The pool's vendor side (reserve / discover / release) goes through the provider
abstraction (`allocate_reserved_ip` / `list_reserved_ips` / `release_reserved_ip`,
see [06-networking.md](./06-networking.md#ipv4-ingress-reserved-ip)); the
attach/detach pair drives the vendor bind, the host 1:1-NAT Task, and the Frappe
invariant together (in failure-safe order).

- `allocate(server)` *(module function)* — reserve a fresh public IPv4 at the
  vendor (in its single region, unassigned) and write an `Allocated` `Reserved
  IP` row for `server`. Returns the new row name. Binding to the droplet + the
  host 1:1-NAT happen on `attach()`, not here.
- `discover(server)` *(module function)* — list the vendor's reserved IPs and
  import any bound to `server`'s droplet that Atlas doesn't yet model, creating
  an `Allocated` row per new one (existing ones skipped). A vendor → Frappe
  reconcile, mapped by droplet id; returns the names created. Throws if the
  Server has no `provider_resource_id`.
- `attach(virtual_machine)` — bind this `Allocated` IP to a VM on the same
  Server. Throws if the IP is already attached, if the VM is on a different
  Server, or if the VM already has a `public_ipv4`. In failure-safe order: (1)
  `assign_reserved_ip` binds the IP to the Server's droplet at the vendor
  (idempotent; Self-Managed no-op); (2) `vm-reserved-ip.py` runs the host 1:1-NAT
  and writes `RESERVED_IPV4` into the VM's `network.env`; (3) only then sets
  `virtual_machine` (→ `status = Attached`) and denormalizes `ip_address` onto
  the VM's `public_ipv4`. The vendor bind and the Task both raise on failure, so
  a half-applied attach never leaves a row claiming an attachment the host lacks.
  Owns the invariant — **one IP, one VM, same Server**. See
  [06-networking.md](./06-networking.md#what-the-host-does).
- `detach()` — release the IP from its VM back to the Server pool (→ `status =
  Allocated`) and clear the VM's `public_ipv4`. Tears down the host NAT via
  `vm-reserved-ip.py` and unbinds the IP at the vendor first, then clears the
  invariant. **Skips the host Task for a Terminated VM** (terminate already
  removed the host networking and `rm -rf`'d the env). Guards a missing VM row.
  Called automatically by `Virtual Machine.terminate()` so a terminated VM
  returns its address to the pool.
- `release()` — destroy the vendor reserved IP and delete this row, returning
  the address to the vendor pool. Refuses while the IP is attached. **Explicit,
  like `Server.archive()`** — destroying the vendor resource is never a side
  effect of deleting the Frappe row (`on_trash` only blocks deleting an attached
  IP; it does not touch the vendor).

### List view

- Columns: `ip_address`, `server`, `status`, `virtual_machine`.
- Standard filters: `server`, `status`, `virtual_machine`.

### Buttons

On the **Reserved IP** form (status-gated):

- **Attach** (primary, shown while `status = Allocated`) — opens a one-field
  dialog (Link → Virtual Machine, filtered to the IP's Server and to VMs without
  a `public_ipv4`) and calls `attach(virtual_machine)`.
- **Release** (under `Actions ▾`, danger, shown while `status = Allocated`) —
  type-to-confirm; calls `release()` to destroy the vendor IP and delete the row.
- **Detach** (under `Actions ▾`, danger, shown while `status = Attached`) —
  calls `detach()`.

On the **Server** form (the pool entry points, `Actions ▾`, while `Active`):

- **Allocate Reserved IP** — cost-confirm; calls `allocate(server)` to reserve a
  new vendor IP and routes to the new row.
- **Discover Reserved IPs** — calls `discover(server)` to import vendor reserved
  IPs bound to this droplet; reports the count. See
  [06-networking.md](./06-networking.md#ipv4-ingress-reserved-ip). The Server's
  Connections panel surfaces the pool under **Networking → Reserved IP**.

## Subdomain

One routing entry for the reverse proxy: a `<subdomain>.<region>.frappe.dev`
name that points at exactly one site VM. The set of **active** Subdomain rows for
a region is the **desired map** every proxy VM in that region serves — the proxy
control plane (`atlas/atlas/proxy.py`) reconciles each proxy guest's live
`lua_shared_dict` to it over SSH. See
[12-proxy.md](./12-proxy.md) for the proxy and the reconcile loop.

Standalone and linked (the `Reserved IP` / `Virtual Machine Snapshot` idiom), not
a child grid on a proxy doctype: every proxy VM holds the **whole** regional map,
so a child-of-proxy model would fight that — the map is owned per **region**, not
per proxy. The row is independently queryable ("which VM does `acme` point at?",
"what's the map for `blr1`?").

### Fields

| Field             | Type                   | Reqd | Read-only | Default | Notes                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`            | = `subdomain` (autoname `field:subdomain`) | Y | Y |    | Primary key is the subdomain label itself. |
| `subdomain`       | Data                   | Y    |           |         | The bare label, `unique` fleet-wide. Reachable at `<subdomain>.<region>.frappe.dev`. The proxy's routing key. `title_field`. Immutable after insert. |
| `region`          | Data                   | Y    |           |         | Which regional proxy fleet fronts it. Every proxy VM in the region serves all active subdomains for the region. Immutable after insert. |
| `active`          | Check                  |      |           | 1       | Inactive rows are excluded from the served map (kept for history). Toggle off to take a site off the front door without deleting the row. |
| `virtual_machine` | Link → Virtual Machine | Y    |           |         | The site VM this subdomain points at. The proxy dials its public IPv6 `:80` (plaintext) over the v6 internet. Immutable after insert. |
| `address`         | Data                   | Y    | Y         |         | The target VM's public IPv6 `/128`, denormalized so the desired-map query is join-free. Kept in sync with the VM's `ipv6_address` on save. The literal the proxy dials. |

Immutability: `subdomain`, `virtual_machine`, and `region` lock after insert —
repointing a live subdomain at a different VM is a delete-and-recreate, so the
proxy map change is explicit, never a silent in-place edit. The one mutable field
is `active` (toggles the mapping in/out of the served map). `address` is always
derived from the linked VM, never hand-edited.

### Controller methods

- `validate()` — denormalizes `address` from the target VM's `ipv6_address`
  (throws if the VM has none — an unaddressable target can't be a route) and
  enforces the immutability above.
- `map_for_region(region)` *(module function)* — returns `{subdomain: address}`
  for every **active** subdomain in the region. This is the full map every proxy
  VM in the region serves; the reconcile loop serializes it canonically
  (`json.dumps(sort_keys=True, indent=2)` + newline, byte-identical to the
  guest's `persist.lua`) and byte-compares it against each proxy guest's live
  `/map`. See [12-proxy.md](./12-proxy.md).

## SSH Key

A public SSH key a dashboard user registers once and chooses when creating a
Virtual Machine. Per-user owned (Frappe's built-in `owner`), like
`Virtual Machine` — a user sees and manages only their own keys, enforced at
the permission layer (see [11-user-ui.md](./11-user-ui.md)). It is pure data:
no Tasks, no lifecycle methods.

The VM's own `ssh_public_key` (immutable, injected into the rootfs) stays the
source of truth for provisioning. The dashboard copies the chosen key's
`public_key` body into the VM on create — so this DocType adds nothing to the
provisioning path; it is a user-facing convenience over the existing field.

### Fields

| Field         | Type      | Reqd | Read-only | Notes                                                            |
| ------------- | --------- | ---- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | (autoname `hash`) | Y | Y     |           | Primary key. 10-char random hex.                                 |
| `key_name`    | Data      | Y    |           | `title_field`. User-chosen label (e.g. `laptop`).                |
| `public_key`  | Long Text | Y    |           | `set_only_once`. OpenSSH public-key body. `validate()` strips it and rejects anything whose first token isn't a known key type (`ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, `ecdsa-*`, `sk-*`). |
| `fingerprint` | Data      |      | Y         | Derived in `validate()` from `public_key` — the standard `SHA256:<base64nopad>` form `ssh-keygen -lf` prints. Shown so the SPA can render a recognizable key identity without echoing the whole blob. |

### Form layout

```
── Overview ──
key_name
fingerprint
── Key ──
public_key
```

### List view

- Columns: `key_name`, `fingerprint`.
- No standard filters (a user's key list is short).

### Permissions

System Manager: all rows, all perms. `Atlas User`: `if_owner`
read/write/create/delete — their own keys only. Scoped by
`permission_query_conditions` (`permissions.owner_only`, wired in `hooks.py`),
the same mechanism as Virtual Machine.

### Buttons

None. The form is data-entry only; the SPA's SSH Keys page (and the New Machine
dialog's inline add) drive creation and deletion through the standard endpoints.

---

## Task

One row per shell script execution against a server. Append-only: every field
is read-only on the form. The system writes the row at insert and again when
the run finishes.

### Fields

| Field                   | Type                   | Reqd | Read-only | Default | Notes                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                  | (autoname `hash`)      | Y    | Y         |         | 10-char random hex (Frappe `autoname = "hash"`). |
| `subject`               | Data                   |      | Y         |         | Set in `before_insert` from `SCRIPT_LABELS[script]` (see [04-tasks.md § Task subject](./04-tasks.md#task-subject)). Verb-only when operating on an existing object (`Reboot`, `Start`, `Sync`), verb-noun when creating one (`Bootstrap Server`, `Create Virtual Machine`, `Sync Image`). `title_field` so the form breadcrumb reads it instead of the hash. Indexed. |
| `server`                | Link → Server          |      | Y         |         | Indexed.                                    |
| `virtual_machine`       | Link → Virtual Machine |      | Y         |         | Set when the task is for one VM. Indexed.   |
| `script`                | Data                   | Y    | Y         |         | Path under `atlas/scripts/`, e.g. `provision-vm.py`. Indexed. |
| `triggered_by`          | Link → User            | Y    | Y         |         | `Administrator` for scheduled jobs.         |
| `status`                | Select                 | Y    | Y         | Pending | `Pending`, `Running`, `Success`, `Failure`. Indexed. |
| `exit_code`             | Int                    |      | Y         |         |                                             |
| `duration_milliseconds` | Int                    |      | Y         |         | Indexed. For sortable list views.           |
| `started`               | Datetime               |      | Y         |         |                                             |
| `ended`                 | Datetime               |      | Y         |         |                                             |
| `variables`             | Long Text (JSON)       | Y    | Y         |         | The env-var dictionary passed to the script.|
| `stdout`                | Code                   |      | Y         |         |                                             |
| `stderr`                | Code                   |      | Y         |         |                                             |

Every operator-visible field is read-only on the form; the table column is
the contract for what the row holds, not for what an operator can type.

`variables` stores the inputs so a task can be replayed by reading the row.
Secrets are not put in `variables`. If a task needs a secret, the secret is
read from another DocType at execution time and not echoed into the Task
record.

### Form layout

A single `Overview` Tab Break with the Output section folded
underneath as a collapsible Section Break (the old `Output` tab is
gone):

```
status
| exit_code
  duration_milliseconds
subject
server
virtual_machine
script
triggered_by
── Timing ──
started
| ended
── Inputs ──
variables
── Output ── (collapsible)
stdout
stderr
```

The client script overlays this with a status-coloured dashboard
headline and a Retry button on Failure. The header `chips` (Server /
VM / Triggered by) and the **Sibling Tasks** quick_list are gone —
both surfaced data already in the form body or the Connections
dashboard. See [10-desk-ui.md § Task](./10-desk-ui.md#task) for the
full behavior.

The controller publishes a `task_update` realtime event (scoped to
the Task's document room) from `after_insert` and `on_update`, with
`{name, status, exit_code, duration_milliseconds, server, virtual_machine, subject}`.
The Task form subscribes and reloads on each tick — long-running
Tasks aren't a black box.

### List view

- Columns (left to right): `subject`, `server`, `virtual_machine`,
  `script`, `status`, `duration_milliseconds`, `started`.
  (Frappe orders list columns by their position in the field schema.
  `started` lives in the Timing section, after the header, so it lands at
  the end of the row. Putting it first would require moving the field
  ahead of the header, which would break the form layout. Operators can
  still sort the list by `started`.)
- Standard filters: `server`, `virtual_machine`, `script`, `status`.

## Domain Provider

Thin link table over the DNS provider abstraction, the exact twin of
[Provider](#provider) for compute. Stores only the identity of a DNS account; all
behavior lives in the registered `DnsProvider`
([atlas/atlas/dns/](../atlas/atlas/dns/)). Used by `Root Domain` to prove control
of a zone during a DNS-01 challenge. See [13-tls.md](./13-tls.md).

### Fields

| Field           | Type   | Reqd | Notes                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------ | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider_name` | Data   | Y    | Primary key (autoname `field:provider_name`), `unique`, `set_only_once`. E.g. `route53-prod`. |
| `provider_type` | Select | Y    | `Route53` / `Cloudflare`. `set_only_once`. Keys the DNS registry. Only Route53 implemented; Cloudflare reserved. |
| `is_active`     | Check  |      | Default 1; **Archive** flips it. `for_domain_provider` refuses an archived row. |

Buttons: **Test Connection** (`dns.for_domain_provider(name).authenticate()` —
Route 53 lists hosted zones), **Archive**.

### Form layout

```
provider_name
provider_type
| is_active
```

### List view

- Columns: `provider_name`, `provider_type`, `is_active`.
- Standard filters: `provider_type`, `is_active`.

## Route53 Settings

A Single. AWS Route 53 credentials, the twin of [DigitalOcean
Settings](#digitalocean-settings). Read by `Route53DnsProvider`; the secret comes
out via `atlas.atlas.secrets.get_secret`.

### Fields

| Field               | Type     | Reqd | Notes                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `access_key_id`     | Data     | Y    | AWS IAM access key id with `route53:*` on the zone. `set_only_once`. |
| `secret_access_key` | Password | Y    | AWS IAM secret. Rotate by clearing via `db.set_value`, then re-saving. |
| `region`            | Data     |      | AWS API region for signing (default `us-east-1`; Route 53 is global). |

No zone-id field: `certbot-dns-route53` discovers the hosted zone from the domain
name at issue time.

## TLS Provider

Thin link table over the TLS issuer abstraction, twin of [Provider](#provider) and
[Domain Provider](#domain-provider). All behavior lives in the registered
`TlsProvider` ([atlas/atlas/tls/](../atlas/atlas/tls/)).

### Fields

| Field           | Type   | Reqd | Notes                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------ | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider_name` | Data   | Y    | Primary key (autoname `field:provider_name`), `unique`, `set_only_once`. E.g. `letsencrypt-prod`. |
| `provider_type` | Select | Y    | `Let's Encrypt` / `ZeroSSL` / `Self-Managed`. `set_only_once`. Keys the TLS registry. Only Let's Encrypt implemented; ZeroSSL is a `frappe.throw` stub; Self-Managed expects operator-supplied PEMs. |
| `is_active`     | Check  |      | Default 1; **Archive** flips it. |

Buttons: **Test Connection** (`tls.for_tls_provider(name).authenticate()`),
**Archive**.

### Form layout

```
provider_name

### List view

- Columns: `provider_name`, `provider_type`, `is_active`.

## Lets Encrypt Settings

A Single. ACME account config read by `LetsEncryptProvider`. The DocType name
drops the apostrophe in "Let's Encrypt" because Frappe scrubs a DocType name into
a Python module path and `Let's Encrypt Settings` would scrub to the unimportable
`let's_encrypt_settings`; the `TLS Provider.provider_type` Select value keeps the
apostrophe (`Let's Encrypt`) since that is data, not a module.

### Fields

| Field               | Type | Reqd | Default | Notes                                                  |

| `acme_directory_url`| Data | Y    | LE production directory | Use the staging URL while testing. |
| `account_email`     | Data | Y    |         | ACME registration / expiry-notice email. `set_only_once`. |
| `agree_tos`         | Check|      | 0       | Required before any certificate can be issued. |

### Form layout

## Root Domain

One wildcard zone == one region. A row `blr1.frappe.dev` owns the regional
wildcard cert `*.blr1.frappe.dev` that fronts the proxy fleet in `region`.
`region` is the join key to `Virtual Machine.region` (`is_proxy=1`). See
[13-tls.md](./13-tls.md).

### Fields

| Field             | Type                  | Reqd | Notes                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`            | = `domain` (autoname `field:domain`) | Y | Primary key is the domain itself. |
| `domain`          | Data                  | Y    | The wildcard zone, e.g. `blr1.frappe.dev`. `unique`, `set_only_once`. The cert is `*.<domain>`. |
| `region`          | Data                  | Y    | The proxy fleet this domain fronts. Join key to `Virtual Machine.region`. `set_only_once`. |
| `is_active`       | Check                 |      | Default 1. |
| `domain_provider` | Link → Domain Provider| Y    | The DNS account that owns the zone (DNS-01). |
| `tls_provider`    | Link → TLS Provider   | Y    | The issuer that produces the cert. |

`domain` and `region` lock after insert. `common_name` (`*.<domain>`) is a derived
property, not a stored field.

### Controller methods

- `issue_certificate()` — **Issue / Renew Certificate** button. Finds or creates
  the domain's single `TLS Certificate` (one cert per domain) and delegates to its
  `issue()`.

### Form layout

```
domain
region

### List view

- Columns: `domain`, `region`, `is_active`.
- Standard filters: `region`, `is_active`.

## TLS Certificate

The issued regional wildcard cert, and the wiring that lands it on every proxy VM
in the domain's region — the producer the proxy's `push_cert` was missing. One per
`Root Domain`. See [13-tls.md](./13-tls.md).

### Fields

| Field            | Type                | Reqd | Read-only | Notes                                                       |

| `common_name`    | Data                |      | Y         | `*.<domain>`, derived from the Root Domain. `title_field`. |
| `status`         | Select              |      | Y         | `Pending` / `Active` / `Expiring` / `Failed`. Set by issue/renew + the scheduler. |
| `tls_provider`   | Link → TLS Provider |      |           | Denormalized from the domain; the issuer used. |
| `issued_on`      | Datetime            |      | Y         | Parsed from the issued cert. |
| `expires_on`     | Datetime            |      | Y         | Parsed from the issued cert; drives `renew_expiring`. |
| `fullchain_path` | Data                |      | Y         | Path to `fullchain.pem` on the controller. Bytes stay out of the DB. |
| `privkey_path`   | Data                |      | Y         | Path to `privkey.pem` on the controller (`0600`, Frappe-user owned). |

### Controller methods

- `issue()` / `renew()` — run the domain's `TlsProvider.issue` (the controller-local
  `issue-cert.py` Task; see [13-tls.md](./13-tls.md)), record paths + dates, set
  `Active`, then `_push_to_proxies()`. On failure, flip `Failed` and re-raise.
- `push_to_proxies()` — **Push to Proxies** button. Read the PEMs off disk and call
  `atlas.atlas.proxy.push_cert(vm, fullchain, privkey)` for every `is_proxy` VM in
