# Tasks: the SSH execution model

A Task is one script invocation against one server, persisted as a row in the
database. The Task is the unit of audit, the unit of replay, and the unit of
failure. The script is a typed Python program (see
[§ Tasks are Python](#tasks-are-python-the-zx-slice-we-built)); a couple of
trivial shell scripts remain.

## What a Task is

```
Task = (server, script, variables) executed over SSH, with captured output
```

Concretely, a Task is a row in `Task` with:

- `server`, `virtual_machine` (optional)
- `script`: the **verb** — the name of a script under `scripts/` with its
  extension dropped, e.g. `provision-vm` (the file on disk is `provision-vm.py`).
  Executed on the host as `atlas provision-vm …`. The on-disk file keeps its
  `.py`/`.sh` suffix; only the Task identifier drops it. `scripts_catalog` is the
  authority that maps a verb to its file (`file_for`) and its nature (`kind`).
- `variables`: a JSON object passed to the script — as `--kebab-case` CLI
  flags for a Python verb, or env vars for a shell verb
- `started`, `ended`, `duration_milliseconds`
- `exit_code`, `stdout`, `stderr`
- `status`: one of `Pending`, `Running`, `Success`, `Failure`
- `triggered_by`: the user

## How it runs

The public SSH surface lives in [`atlas/atlas/ssh.py`](../atlas/atlas/ssh.py)
(a re-export shim over `atlas/atlas/_ssh/{runner,transport}.py`). The symbols
used by every controller and test:

```python
def run_task(*, script, variables, server=None, connection=None,
             virtual_machine=None, timeout_seconds=1800) -> Task:
    """Insert a Task row, run the script over SSH, update the row.

    Exactly one of `server` or `connection` is required:
      - server=<name>  — production path. Loads the Server doc and builds
                         the Connection from it. Every DocType button calls
                         this form.
      - connection=<Connection> — bootstrap path. Used before the Server
                         row has a usable provider linkage (`finish_provisioning`
                         uses it indirectly through `wait_for_ssh`).
    """

def execute_task(task_name: str) -> None:
    """Background-job entrypoint. Reads an already-inserted Pending Task,
    runs it via the same code path, updates the row. Called via
    `frappe.enqueue` for long Tasks (image sync)."""

def connection_for_server(server) -> Connection:
    """Build the SSH Connection from a Server doc. Reads the private-key
    path off `Atlas Settings.ssh_private_key_path` via
    `atlas.get_ssh_private_key_path()` and loads the PEM at SSH-connect
    time. Only guard is `Server.ipv4_address` — `Server.provider_type` is not
    read by this function (the SSH key is vendor-agnostic)."""

def connection_for_guest(virtual_machine) -> Connection:
    """The SECOND SSH target type: a guest, not a host. Builds a Connection
    to a VM's public IPv6 `/128`, as `root`, with the SAME Atlas key — its
    public half is already in the guest's `root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
    (injected by the rootfs at provision), so no new image plumbing. Used by
    the proxy control plane (`atlas/atlas/proxy.py`) to reach a proxy guest's
    unix-socket admin API over SSH (map sync, cert push). The admin socket's
    file permissions remain the gate inside the guest. See [12-proxy.md]."""

def upload_files(connection, files: list[tuple[str, str]]) -> None:
    """scp a list of (local, remote) pairs. Not a Task. Used by
    `Server.bootstrap()` to lay down helpers + the systemd unit before
    the bootstrap script runs."""

def wait_for_ssh(connection, timeout_seconds: int = 300) -> None:
    """Poll the host until `ssh ... true` returns 0, or raise. Used after
    droplet create, before bootstrap."""
```

`scp` and `ssh` inside `run_task` are the system commands, invoked via
`subprocess.run()`. Not paramiko. Not fabric. Not anything else.

### Why the system `ssh`

- It is everywhere. Frappe servers already have it.
- `~/.ssh/config`, `known_hosts`, agent forwarding, `ControlMaster` — all
  just work.
- We avoid pinning a Python library to a Python version. SSH is stable.
- Debugging: an operator can copy-paste the same `ssh` invocation from a Task
  row and run it by hand.

### Connection details

- User: `root` — for both target types. The host path SSHes a Server by its
  public v4; the guest path (`connection_for_guest`) SSHes a VM by its public
  v6 `/128`, also as `root`, with the same key (the guest's
  `root/.ssh/authorized_keys` already carries it). `Connection.user` is the
  field that carries this, defaulting to `root`.
- Auth: SSH private key read from the path on
  `Atlas Settings.ssh_private_key_path` (a `0600` PEM on the Atlas host,
  see [07-filesystem-layout.md § SSH keys](./07-filesystem-layout.md)).
  The key is loaded via `secrets.get_ssh_key_from_disk(path)` at
  SSH-connect time and written to a short-lived tempfile (`mode 0600`)
  for the `ssh`/`scp` invocation.
- Options we always pass:
  - `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new` — accept on first contact, fail on
    later changes. (Host-key pinning is on the [roadmap](./09-roadmap.md).)
  - `-o UserKnownHostsFile=~/.atlas/known_hosts` — keep host keys out of the
    user's normal `known_hosts`.
  - `-o BatchMode=yes` — never prompt.
  - `-o ConnectTimeout=30`.
  - `-o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPath=~/.atlas/cm/%C -o ControlPersist=60s`
    — connection multiplexing. A Task that stages a sidecar opens 2+ connections
    to the same host back-to-back (stage, then run the script); the first does
    the TCP+SSH handshake and the rest ride the shared master socket. A durable,
    sidecar-free Task is a single run, and back-to-back Tasks reuse the master
    too (`ControlPersist`). `%C` (a hash of user/host/port) keeps concurrent
    Tasks to different servers on distinct sockets. This is a dominant latency
    win for a remote provision — each avoided handshake is ~1.5s+ over a real
    droplet.
- Variables: how they reach the script depends on the verb's nature
  (`scripts_catalog.kind(verb)` — never a suffix-sniff; see
  [§ Tasks are Python](#tasks-are-python-the-zx-slice-we-built)):
  - **Python verb** — `ssh ... atlas <verb> --kebab-flag val …`. The
    pip-installed `atlas` console script on `PATH` (`/usr/local/bin/atlas`)
    dispatches to the typed entry point; no interpreter path, no `PYTHONPATH` —
    the durable `uv pip install` put both the package and the console entry into
    the Atlas venv at bootstrap (see
    [03-bootstrapping.md § The Atlas interpreter and CLI](./03-bootstrapping.md)).
    The `variables` dict keys (`UPPER_SNAKE`) become `--kebab-case` CLI flags; a
    list value becomes a repeated flag. Quoted with `shlex.quote()`. This is the
    bulk of Tasks and needs no per-Task scp (next section). A stale/legacy host
    with no `atlas` on `PATH` surfaces this as the Task's own
    `atlas: command not found` — the fail-fast moved from a per-Task `test -e`
    round trip to **once-at-bootstrap** (`Server.cli_ready`, set when the
    bootstrap sanity gate proved `atlas --help` dispatches).
    `bootstrap-server` is an ordinary Python verb here too: [`scripts/install.sh`](../scripts/install.sh)
    creates the venv + console script over SSH *before* the bootstrap Task (see
    [03-bootstrapping.md](./03-bootstrapping.md)), so by the time it runs the
    interpreter already exists — no carve-out, no stock-`python3` branch.
  - **Shell verb** — `ssh ... env VAR=val VAR2=val2 bash -x /var/lib/atlas/bin/reboot-server.sh`.
    The legacy form, kept for the few remaining shell verbs (`reboot-server`) and
    the e2e probes. Shell verbs run their file by path.
  Both shapes are built in `_ssh/runner.py::_remote_command()`, dispatched on
  `scripts_catalog.kind(verb)` — not a filename suffix.

### Timeouts

- Connect: 30 seconds.
- Script execution: 30 minutes default, overridable per call. Most scripts
  finish in seconds; image syncs are the long pole.

## One Task = one script. Not one Task = one command.

The old design had one row per shell command. That was clean but it forced
network round-trips between every `mkdir` and `cp`, which made VM
provisioning take seconds longer than it had to and produced 8 rows per
provision.

The new design: a Task is whatever the script does. `provision-vm.py` does
five things in one process. If step 3 fails, the script exits non-zero, the
Task is `Failure`, and the operator reads the Task to see which step.

The rule:

> A Task is one shell script. Compose at the script level, not at the SSH
> level. If you find yourself running two scripts back-to-back from Python,
> ask whether they should be one script.

### Trade-off

We lose fine-grained "which sub-step failed" visibility — the Task only knows
the script exited with code N. We gain:

- Provisioning is fast (one SSH connect, no per-step latency).
- The whole thing runs in one process, so a failure aborts the rest (`set -e`
  in a `.sh` task; `run()` raising in a `.py` task).
- The script is the spec for what gets done; it has no Python coupling.
- The Task is replayable: same script, same variables → same result (modulo
  external state).

### Why not zx?

[zx](https://github.com/google/zx) is "write shell in JavaScript". The good
idea is *structured outputs and ergonomic shell composition*. Our equivalent
is *one self-contained shell script that takes env-var inputs and exits
non-zero on failure*. We get the ergonomics from Bash itself (`set -euo
pipefail`, heredocs, traps). When we eventually need typed orchestration —
fanout across servers, conditional branches, retries — we will reimplement
the small slice we need in Python, not adopt zx. See the
[roadmap](./09-roadmap.md).

## Tasks are Python (the zx slice we built)

The features grew, the scripts grew complicated, and the verifiability the
"Why not zx?" section promised arrived: **a Task script is now a typed,
self-contained Python program**, not a shell script. The contract is
unchanged — a Task is still one script invocation over one SSH connection,
idempotent, exits non-zero on failure, replayable — but the implementation
language is Python 3 (already on every Ubuntu 24.04 host; no new dependency).

`reboot-server.sh` is the lone holdover (two lines); everything else under
[`scripts/`](../scripts/) is `<name>.py`. The runner runs Python and shell verbs
side by side — `scripts_catalog.kind(verb)` is the authority on which is which
(it reads the on-disk file's extension), so the catalog, not a `Task.script`
suffix-sniff, draws the boundary.

### Why Python, not "harden the shell"

The *variables* were never the problem — they are pure functions of the VM
UUID in [`networking.py`](../atlas/atlas/networking.py), unit-tested already.
What grew unmaintainable was the *execution logic* that crept into shell:
idempotency gates, error recovery (`lvremove` on a failed `dd`), string
surgery that exists only because bash is bad at it (the `lsblk` MAJ:MIN
whitespace strip, the `mapfile` dance to keep `cpu.max`'s internal space).
None of that could be unit-tested in bash without a real host — exactly the
class of defect that passes static + unit checks and fails on a droplet.

Porting that logic to Python makes it **unit-testable on the Atlas host with
no droplet**: the lib modules are stdlib-only (no Frappe, no site), so their
pure functions test in milliseconds (`python3 -m unittest atlas.test_lvm
atlas.test_host` from [`scripts/lib`](../scripts/lib)). This is the spec's
own "host facts vs. unit-covered logic" split, pushed down into the scripts.

### Shape of a Task script

Three pieces, one painfully simple `main()`:

```python
# scripts/snapshot-vm.py
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SnapshotInputs(TaskInputs):
    command: typing.ClassVar[str] = "snapshot-vm"
    virtual_machine_name: str            # → --virtual-machine-name (required)
    snapshot_rootfs_path: str            # → --snapshot-rootfs-path

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SnapshotResult(TaskResult):
    size_bytes: int

def main() -> None:
    inputs = SnapshotInputs.from_args()          # typed; argparse gives --help
    pool = ThinPool()
    disk = pool.vm_disk(inputs.virtual_machine_name)
    snapshot = pool.from_device(inputs.snapshot_rootfs_path)
    if not disk.exists: sys.exit("disk LV not found …")
    if pool.usage.too_full_to_snapshot: sys.exit("thin pool too full …")
    disk.snapshot_into(snapshot)
    SnapshotResult(size_bytes=snapshot.size_bytes).emit()
```

- **Typed input**, not env soup. Each `TaskInputs` field is a `--kebab-case`
  CLI flag ([`scripts/lib/atlas/_task.py`](../scripts/lib/atlas/_task.py)).
  `from_args()` parses argv once; argparse gives `--help` and exit-2 on a
  missing/!int flag for free — the CLI form of `${VAR:?required}`. A `list`
  field is a repeatable flag (`--cgroup-arg a --cgroup-arg b`), which is what
  kills the shell's `mapfile`/word-splitting workaround: a value with an
  internal space stays one argv token. **This is the shape the `atlas` host CLI
  mounts directly** — each task is already a subcommand
  ([`_cli.py`](../scripts/lib/atlas/_cli.py)). The CLI is no longer just a debug
  face: the runner *executes every Python verb through it* (`atlas stop-vm …`),
  installed at bootstrap via `uv pip install` (see
  [03-bootstrapping.md § The `atlas` host CLI](./03-bootstrapping.md)).
- **Typed output**, not stdout scraping. A task that returns data emits one
  `ATLAS_RESULT=<json>` line via `TaskResult.emit()`; the controller decodes
  it with `task_results.parse_result()`. This replaced the `SIZE_BYTES=` grep
  and the bootstrap-JSON tail-line read — and fixes their silent-on-truncation
  bug (`parse_result` raises if the marker is absent).
- **OO host actions.** `ThinPool` / `LogicalVolume`
  ([`lvm.py`](../scripts/lib/atlas/lvm.py)), `VirtualMachinePaths`
  ([`paths.py`](../scripts/lib/atlas/paths.py)), `prepare_lv` / `inject_identity`
  ([`rootfs.py`](../scripts/lib/atlas/rootfs.py)). The one place that touches
  the host is `run()` in [`_run.py`](../scripts/lib/atlas/_run.py) — it echoes
  each command (the `set -x` trace into the Task log) and raises on non-zero
  (the `set -e` abort). Everything else is pure functions over strings.

  **`run()` reads like a shell line, safely.** It takes a single command STRING;
  interpolated values go through `{}` placeholders that are `shlex.quote`d
  automatically, then the whole string is `shlex.split` into an argv and run with
  `shell=False` (**no shell, ever**):

  ```python
  run("sudo systemctl stop nginx")                       # literals: clean
  run("sudo ip link set {} up", tap_device)              # one var, auto-quoted
  run("sudo ip -6 route replace {}/128 dev {}", ip, tap) # two vars
  ```

  This is the parameterized-SQL trust model (`execute("… WHERE id = ?", id)`):
  literal template, quoted holes, and *forgetting to quote is not expressible* —
  the property the earlier variadic-argv form gave by construction is preserved
  (a value with an internal space, a `;`, a `|`, a `$(…)` stays exactly one argv
  token and cannot break out), now with the obvious single-string reading. The
  substitution is a tiny custom engine (`_substitute`/`_render`), **not**
  `str.format()`: this codebase is brace-heavy (nft `{ type filter … }` clauses
  appear verbatim in commands), and the engine consumes only the literal `{}`
  token, leaving every other brace untouched, so those clauses migrate with zero
  escaping. Two escape hatches: `shell()` is the *only* way to invoke a real `sh
  -c` pipeline (`|`, `>`, `*`, `&&` honoured in the template, params still
  auto-quoted), and an nft brace-clause that must reach `nft` as ONE argv element
  is passed as a `{}` param (so `shlex.split` doesn't re-tokenize it). The
  remote/SSH layer (`run_ssh`) shares the SAME `{}` author syntax but keeps the
  rendered command a STRING — it is the line the remote sshd hands to the remote
  shell, so it is quote-substituted but never locally `shlex.split`. Everything
  else is pure functions over strings.

### The shared `atlas` package and how it is staged

The lib lives in [`scripts/lib/atlas/`](../scripts/lib/atlas) and is
**stdlib-only today** — which is why the logic tests with no host. (That is a
convenience, not a guarded invariant: the host installs the package into a venv,
so a real dependency is fine — uv resolves it at `uv pip install`.) A Task script
imports it from **one durable copy** on the host:

- **Durable placement** (`Server.bootstrap()`): the package is placed once at
  `/var/lib/atlas/bin/atlas/`, beside the three systemd-hook scripts, so they
  and `atlas-pool.service` can `import atlas` after a reboot. The file list is
  computed from disk (`test_*.py` skipped), so a new lib module ships with no
  map edit.
- **Tasks reach it as the pip-installed `atlas` console script**:
  [`scripts/install.sh`](../scripts/install.sh) — run over SSH by
  `Server.bootstrap()` right after the upload — runs `uv pip install
  /var/lib/atlas/bin` into the Atlas venv, registering the `atlas` entry point
  (and resolving the package's imports against that same durable tree). A Python
  verb then runs as `atlas <verb>` — no `PYTHONPATH`, no per-Task scp of the
  package. Only per-verb sidecars (sync-image's guest `atlas-network.service`, in
  `SCRIPT_SIDECARS`) are uploaded. This removes ~9 scp round-trips from every Task;
  combined with SSH multiplexing it takes a remote provision from ~20s+ toward a
  few seconds.

  **Staleness trade-off (deliberate):** because the package is shipped + installed
  only at bootstrap, a controller-side change to a lib module reaches a host only
  on the next `bootstrap` — bootstrap is the single refresh point. This is the
  same contract the systemd hooks already follow (they too run the durable copy).
  Re-run `bootstrap` (idempotent) after changing anything under
  `scripts/lib/atlas/`. With install.sh creating the venv before the bootstrap
  Task, there is no carve-out: `bootstrap-server` runs as `atlas bootstrap-server`
  on the venv python like every other verb.

- **The entry scripts are durable too.** Bootstrap / `sync_scripts` ship every
  host Task entry FILE (`scripts_catalog.host_task_scripts()` yields verbs;
  `file_for` maps each to its file — provision-vm.py, start/stop/snapshot-stop,
  …) to `/var/lib/atlas/bin/` beside the package, where `uv pip install` registers
  the console script and the runner reaches each as `atlas <verb>` **in place**:
  no per-Task `mkdir`+`scp`, just the one run. The scp was the dominant latency of
  an otherwise sub-second op — dropping it took a live stop from ~2.2s to ~0.6s,
  start ~2.8s→~1.1s, and provision ~5.7s→~3.0s on a real droplet. Same staleness
  contract as the package (re-bootstrap / `sync_scripts` to refresh). The staging
  path and its stale-lib purge survive only for **shell verbs not shipped durably**
  — the **e2e probes** (resolved from the test-only directory) — and any **sidecar
  files** (`sync-image`'s guest unit) staged before a python verb runs.

### Systemd hooks are Python too, but not Tasks

`vm-disk-up.py`, `vm-network-up.py`, `vm-network-down.py`, `vm-restore.py`
run from the VM unit's `ExecStartPre`/`ExecStartPost`/`ExecStopPost`, not over
SSH. They take a **positional uuid** (`%i`), not `--flags`, and import the
durable package. They are excluded from
`scripts_catalog.allowed_scripts()` (`SYSTEMD_HOOKS`) so the Task runner
never executes them. Like every Python Task they run under the **Atlas venv
python** — the units invoke `/var/lib/atlas/venv/bin/python <hook> %i`, and
`atlas-pool.service` runs the pool bring-up inline:
`/var/lib/atlas/venv/bin/python -c "… ThinPool().ensure()"` (see
[03-bootstrapping.md § The Atlas interpreter and CLI](./03-bootstrapping.md)).
There is no shell helper library (`lvm.sh`) anymore — the durable `atlas`
package replaced it.

A second, **controller-only** bucket (`CONTROLLER_ONLY`: `issue-cert.py`,
`tunnel-up/down.py`, `mgmt-firewall-*.py`) is also excluded from
`allowed_scripts()` — those run on the *controller* via the local runner, never
over SSH onto a host. The host `atlas` CLI ([§ Tasks are Python](#shape-of-a-task-script))
discovers its commands from the filesystem and **does not** currently filter this
bucket, so its command set is a superset of the host-SSH catalog. That is a
known, deferred gap (Phase 2): running one of these on a host mostly just fails
(they need controller-side context / deps), and the intended fix is to install
the same CLI on the controller so `atlas mgmt-firewall-apply …` runs where it
belongs — at which point the CLI's *available* command set is context-dependent
(host vs controller) rather than wrong. Until Phase 2, do not assume
`_cli` command set == `allowed_scripts()`.

## How Python triggers a Task

From any DocType method:

```python
from atlas.atlas.ssh import run_task

def provision(self):
    variables = {
        "VIRTUAL_MACHINE_NAME": self.name,
        "IMAGE_NAME": self.image,
        ...
    }
    run_task(
        server=self.server,
        script="provision-vm.py",
        variables=variables,
        virtual_machine=self.name,
    )
```

The method is sync from the caller's perspective. For long tasks, callers
wrap it in `frappe.enqueue` (Frappe's background job queue) so the operator
isn't blocked in Desk.

### Sync vs queued, by script

| Script                | Path                     | Why                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bootstrap-server.py` | Queued (`finish_provisioning`) | 30–60s; chained after `wait_for_active` + `wait_for_ssh`. |
| `sync-image.py`       | Queued (`execute_task`)  | Minutes; downloads ~600MB.                                          |
| `provision-vm.py`     | Sync                     | ~3s; operator waits.                                                |
| `start-vm.py` / `stop-vm.py` / `terminate-vm.py` | Sync | <1s.                                                  |
| `snapshot-stop-vm.py`  | Sync                    | The opt-in memory-capturing stop; pause + RAM dump + stop. Seconds, bounded by RAM size / disk write speed. |
| `warm-snapshot-vm.py`  | Sync (Image Build job, or `Virtual Machine.capture_warm_snapshot()`) | The warm capture: pause + RAM dump + disk LVM snapshot to a durable directory + resume. Same bound as the fast stop; inside a bake the enclosing job runs on `queue="long"`, and the per-VM operator action runs it directly. |
| `promote-snapshot-image.py` | Sync (via `Virtual Machine Snapshot.promote_to_image()`) | Promote a cold snapshot LV into a same-server read-only `atlas-image-<name>` base image (local `dd`) + materialize its image dir. Seconds (a local dd of the disk), bounded by disk write speed. See [08-images.md](./08-images.md#two-origins-for-a-base-image-a-url-or-a-snapshot-promote). |
| `vm-reserved-ip.py`   | Sync (via `Reserved IP.attach()`/`detach()`) | <1s; applies/removes the inbound-v4 1:1-NAT live. |
| `reboot-server.sh`    | Sync (via `run_task_dialog`) | The SSH drops mid-Task; the operator confirms by reconnecting. |
| Ad-hoc via Run Task   | Sync                     | The dialog is the operator's "I want to see this finish" path.      |

The "queue or not" decision lives in the calling DocType method, not in
`run_task`. Both paths funnel through the same `_execute_into` core.

### Queued-task ownership

For queued Tasks, the button handler runs in the request and the script
runs in the worker. The two-step pattern is:

1. **In the request**: the handler inserts a Task row with
   `status = "Pending"` and the full variables block, commits, then calls
   `frappe.enqueue("atlas.atlas.ssh.execute_task", task_name=task.name,
   queue="long", timeout=...)`. Returns the task name.
2. **In the worker**: `execute_task(task_name)` loads the row, builds the
   Connection from `task.server`, runs the script, and updates the row.

The Pending row is the operator's receipt: it shows up in the Task list
immediately, even before the worker has picked it up. If the worker never
runs (queue down), the row sits in `Pending` forever — visible enough that
the operator notices.

For the long Tasks (image sync, the in-guest bench/proxy bakes), the Task row
is also the **live progress carrier**: its output is streamed onto the row while
the script runs, not written once on exit, and a `Running Operations` view
collects every in-flight Task fleet-wide. See
[22-observability.md](./22-observability.md).

For sync Tasks (Provision/Start/Stop/Terminate, Run Task dialog) the
button handler calls `run_task` directly; row insert and run happen back
to back in one process.

## Idempotency

Every script in `atlas/scripts/` is idempotent. Re-running a script with the
same inputs is safe. We do not have automatic retry — the operator retries
by clicking the button again, which creates a new Task.

## Failure handling

If a script exits non-zero:

1. The Task row is marked `Failure` with the exit code and full stdout/stderr.
2. The Python caller's `run_task` raises `frappe.ValidationError`.
3. The calling DocType method catches it, sets its own `status` field
   appropriately (e.g. `Virtual Machine.status = Failed`), and re-raises so
   Desk shows the error.

The Task row is the authoritative record; the doc's status is a denormalized

## Sidecar uploads ([`script_uploads.py`](../atlas/atlas/script_uploads.py))

Before a Python Task runs, `run_task` stages only **per-script sidecars** —
extra files a specific task needs — beside the script. The shared `atlas`
package is **not** among them: it lives durably at `/var/lib/atlas/bin/atlas/`
(placed by `Server.bootstrap()`) and Tasks reach it via
`PYTHONPATH=/var/lib/atlas/bin` (see [§ the shared `atlas` package and how it is
staged](#the-shared-atlas-package-and-how-it-is-staged)). So a durable Python
Task with no sidecar uploads **zero** files and stages nothing — it runs the
durable script in place. A sidecar Task stages only its sidecar(s).

The canonical sidecar is `sync-image.py`, which needs the guest
`atlas-network.service` unit staged so it can be embedded into the ext4 it
builds. These live in a small map:

```python
SCRIPT_SIDECARS: dict[str, list[tuple[str, str]]] = {
    "sync-image.py": [
        ("scripts/guest/atlas-network.service",
         "/tmp/atlas/atlas-network.service"),
    ],
}
```

The script reads a sidecar by its staged path, passed as a CLI flag
(e.g. `--guest-network-unit /tmp/atlas/atlas-network.service`).

The systemd-hook scripts (`vm-network-up.py`, `vm-network-down.py`,
`vm-disk-up.py`), the unit files, and the durable `atlas` package are placed at
`/var/lib/atlas/bin/` (and `/var/lib/atlas/bin/atlas/`) by `Server.bootstrap()`
calling `upload_files` directly. See [03-bootstrapping.md](./03-bootstrapping.md).

## Scripts catalog

The list of scripts an operator can run lives in
[`atlas/atlas/scripts_catalog.py`](../atlas/atlas/scripts_catalog.py):

- `allowed_scripts()` returns the sorted `.py` and `.sh` filenames directly
  under [`scripts/`](../scripts/). This is the whitelist used by the SSH
  runner and the `Server.run_task_dialog` controller method.
  `scripts/guest/` and `scripts/systemd/` are excluded (not host-runnable),
  and so are the systemd-hook scripts (`SYSTEMD_HOOKS`: `vm-disk-up.py`,
  `vm-network-up.py`, `vm-network-down.py`, `vm-restore.py`) — they run from
  the VM unit with a positional uuid, not as Tasks.
- `operator_visible_scripts()` is the strict subset the desk's `Run Task`
  picker is allowed to expose: `bootstrap-server.py`,
  `reboot-server.sh`, `sync-image.py`. Everything else
  (`provision-vm.py`, `start-vm.py`, `terminate-vm.py`, …) is a
  state-machine move that must originate from a VM or Image controller
  method — the operator drives it via the VM form's lifecycle buttons,
  not by hand-firing the script with empty variables.
- `resolve(script)` locates a script file in either `scripts/` or the
  e2e-only `atlas/tests/e2e/scripts/` directory (used by tests).

The split is enforced at the boundary, not deep in: `Server.get_scripts()`
returns `operator_visible_scripts()` for the desk picker, while
`Server.run_task_dialog` continues to validate against
`allowed_scripts()`. Internal callers (`Server.bootstrap`, `Server.reboot`,
VM lifecycle methods) keep working unchanged.

## Task subject

The `subject` field is the operator-facing label on every Task row.
The rule, encoded in `SCRIPT_LABELS` on `Task` and applied at
`before_insert`:

- **Verb only** when the script operates on the same object the Task
  is anchored to — `Reboot`, `Start`, `Stop`, `Restart`, `Terminate`.
  The Server / Virtual Machine column on the row carries the target
  identity; the subject doesn't need to repeat it.
- **Verb + Noun** when the script creates a new object — `Bootstrap
  Server` (creates host state from nothing), `Sync Image` (creates
  server-side state for an existing image), `Create Virtual Machine`
  (creates a new VM).

The legacy `<verb> · <target>` shape (e.g. `Provision VM · verify
vnet_hdr fix on bootstrap-server-…`) is gone — the target identity
lives in the row's columns and the form's link fields. Existing rows
were rewritten by
[`atlas/patches/v1_0/rebuild_task_subjects.py`](../atlas/patches/v1_0/rebuild_task_subjects.py).

The Task list-view's Status column renders a coloured pill driven by
the `states` JSON on the DocType (`Pending` yellow, `Running` blue,
`Success` green, `Failure` red); the legacy
`task_list.js::indicator` is gone for the status. The `subject`
formatter renders the bare subject — the earlier ` · <duration>`
suffix was dropped (duration is one column away on the form).

## Per-script dialogs — no catch-all Run Task

There is no generic **Run Task** dialog on the Server form. Each
operator-visible script gets its own first-class Actions item with a
typed dialog:

- **Sync Image** — a one-field dialog (Link → Virtual Machine Image,
  `only_select: 1`, `is_active = 1` filter). Calls
  `Server.sync_image(image)`, which delegates to `Virtual Machine
  Image.sync_to_server(self.name)`.
- **Re-bootstrap** — a `confirm_destructive` dialog (type the server
  title). Calls `Server.bootstrap()`.
- **Reboot** — a `confirm_destructive` dialog (type the server title).
  Calls `Server.reboot()`.

The whitelisted `Server.run_task_dialog(script, variables)` method
survives for two non-operator callers: `Task.retry()` (so a failed
Task can be re-fired against any whitelisted script) and the
`desk_buttons` e2e suite. It is no longer surfaced as a button on the
form.

The `operator_visible_scripts()` subset stays narrow — currently just
`bootstrap-server.py`, `reboot-server.sh`, `sync-image.py`. Lifecycle
scripts (`provision-vm.py`, `start-vm.py`, `terminate-vm.py`, …) are
state-machine moves that originate from the VM controller's lifecycle
buttons, never from a Server-form picker.

## Retrying a failed Task

Failed Tasks expose a **Retry** button on the form. `Task.retry()` is a
whitelisted method that:

- For VM lifecycle scripts (`provision-vm.py`, `start-vm.py`,
  `stop-vm.py`, `snapshot-stop-vm.py`, `restart-vm.py`,
  `terminate-vm.py`): loads the linked
  Virtual Machine and calls the matching controller method
  (`vm.provision()`, `vm.start()`, …). The state-machine guards on the
  VM live there; Retry does not duplicate them. If the VM is in a
  state that disallows the action, the controller's existing
  `frappe.throw` surfaces to the operator.
- For operator-visible server scripts (`bootstrap-server.py`,
  `reboot-server.sh`, `sync-image.py`): re-invokes
  `Server.run_task_dialog(self.script, self.variables_dict)` so the
  retry is recorded as a fresh Task row with the original variables.
- For anything else (e.g. an ad-hoc `noop.sh`): throws "not retriable
  from the Task form."

A retry is a new Task row, not a mutation of the failed one. The audit
trail keeps both.

## Why SSH, not HTTP

The transport is SSH and stays SSH. We measured the alternative — a resident
host server that runs `atlas <verb>` on an HTTP POST instead of an SSH exec — to
see whether the per-Task SSH handshake was a real cost. It is not: with both
sides keeping a warm channel (SSH ControlMaster, HTTP keep-alive), HTTP and SSH
are statistically indistinguishable. The lifecycle wall time is gated by what
`atlas <verb>` does on the host (cold-booting Firecracker for provision/start,
tearing down the jail for terminate), not by how the verb is delivered.

VM lifecycle, e2e.local, n=10 each, host-side Task duration (ms):

| operation | SSH avg | HTTP avg |
| --------- | ------: | -------: |
| provision |    1739 |     1692 |
| stop      |     560 |      526 |
| start     |    1194 |     1145 |
| terminate |    1426 |     1396 |

Every operation lands within ~3–5% of the other transport — inside the
run-to-run noise (the within-transport spread exceeds the between-transport
gap), and the nominal winner flips direction between runs. The gap is on the
order of ~50 ms per operation.

**Don't switch to HTTP unless we're optimizing at the ~50 ms scale** — and even
then it is the wrong lever, because the host-side verb cost (the ~1.7 s
provision, the ~1.4 s terminate) dwarfs it. Note also that the measured HTTP
path was plaintext; a real deployment would need HTTPS (or the management tunnel),
whose handshake would only widen the gap against HTTP. SSH already gives us an
authenticated, encrypted channel for free, so there is no transport win to chase
here. (The PoC HTTP transport written to take these numbers has been removed.)
