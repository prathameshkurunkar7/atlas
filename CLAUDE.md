# Atlas Repository Guide

## Session continuity

- Treat this file as the primary instruction source for every task.
- After context compaction, summarization, restart, or loss of working context, read this file again before you continue.
- Preserve a reference to `CLAUDE.md` in a handover or context summary so the next context reloads it.
- Do not rely on remembered repository rules when this file is available.

Atlas is a monorepo for Frappe Cloud V2 VM infrastructure. It contains a Frappe app, Go services, an OpenResty proxy, and eBPF programs.

## Start here

Read the [root specification](SPEC.md) for the project layout and component map. Read the matching component `SPEC.md` before you make a structural change.

Re-read `CLAUDE.md` after context compaction or a resumed session before you continue work.

- [Atlas app](atlas/SPEC.md)
- [Metal](metal/SPEC.md)
- [HTTP proxy](services/http-proxy/SPEC.md)
- [WG Mesh](services/wg-mesh/SPEC.md)

## Core principles

- Keep changes small, direct, and in the component that owns the behavior.
- Keep decision-making visible to the user. Before implementation, explain the proposed design, assumptions, ownership, state, dependencies, error flow, risks, and important trade-offs. Use a small ASCII relationship diagram when it helps. Do not leave a material engineering decision unstated. Proceed after the user agrees with the plan.
- Do not change unrelated dirty files, generated artifacts, or local data.
- Do not add plan files, such as `plan_*.md`.
- Prefer clear, explicit code over clever code and unnecessary abstraction.
- Store mutable and temporary state in the object, task, or goroutine that owns its lifecycle. Do not duplicate mutable state across owners.
- Fail near the cause. Retry only operations that are safe to repeat.
- Do not add a dependency when the standard library or an existing repository dependency is sufficient.
- Do not commit secrets, private keys, tokens, `.env` content, or production credentials.
- Regenerate checked-in generated artifacts only when their source changes.
- Use `git mv` when you intentionally move or rename a tracked file.

## Temporary rules

Atlas is in active development and is not deployed to production.

- Do not preserve backward compatibility unless the task or specification requires it.
- Prefer the target design over compatibility layers, migration shims, deprecated aliases, or fallback behavior.
- Do not design for rolling upgrades, mixed-version deployments, or zero-downtime migration unless required.
- Revisit these rules before the first production deployment.

## Code style

### All code

- Use complete words for names. A Go method receiver can use a short name.
- Put blank lines between logical code blocks in a function.
- Put behavior with the type, module, or package that owns it.
- Extend an existing folder or package before you add a new one. Group related files and avoid crowded folders.
- Do not add generic `utils`, `helpers`, `common`, or similar folders.
- Do not add comments that repeat the code. Explain a business rule, invariant, external quirk, or concurrency rule only when needed.
- Add focused tests for meaningful behavior and failure cases. Do not add tests only to increase coverage.
- Keep tests deterministic and independent.

### Python

- Keep Python domain behavior in its domain object, manager, or task. Keep CLI commands and API routes thin.
- Use type hints for public functions and important data structures.
- Raise specific exceptions. Handle only errors that the code can recover from.
- Avoid mutable global state, circular imports, and dependency injection that does not reduce coupling.
- Prefer small functions and clear object-oriented code when it fits the domain.
- Use binary units. Name a field for its unit, such as `disk_mib` and `throughput_mibps`.
- Use `@property` only for a cheap, side-effect-free, no-argument operation that returns one noun-like value.
- Keep a method public when callers outside its owner use it. Prefix implementation-only methods with `_`. Use domain verbs instead of a generic `get_` name when they explain the operation.
- Name boolean properties and methods with `is_` or `has_`.

### Go

- For a Go change, use the approved plan, task, and specification as the design source. Ask the user when ownership, package boundaries, state, interfaces, concurrency, or error flow remain materially unclear.
- Prefer concrete types. Define a small interface at its consumer only when it has a real need.
- Add one useful package comment to each Go package. Add a doc comment to each exported declaration. Start an exported doc comment with its name.
- Use `NewType` for constructors. Do not use unnecessary `Get` prefixes.
- Wrap errors with useful context and preserve errors that callers inspect.
- Pass `context.Context` first to operations that can block.
- Avoid global mutable state. Define goroutine ownership, shutdown, and channel closing.
- Use standard-library and repository helpers before you add an abstraction.
- Run `gofmt`, focused tests, `go vet`, and the race detector when relevant. Keep Go module boundaries.

## Documentation

- Write documentation for the reader who must use, change, or operate the system.
- Use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English. Use short, direct sentences and one term for one thing.
- Keep each Markdown prose paragraph on one source line. Do not use em dashes.
- Describe current behavior only. Do not describe removed behavior or old interfaces.
- Use a clear documentation tree: root README, component overview, focused topic documents, then detailed specifications when needed.
- Keep closely related behavior together. Do not split documentation only to make files smaller.
- Use a README as an entry point. Use `SPEC.md` as a short router to detailed documents when a component needs one.
- Put detailed behavior in one authoritative location. Link from summaries to the detailed document and back when useful.
- Use headings that answer a reader question, such as Purpose, Configuration, Operation, or Validation.
- Use a list or table for more than 3 related items. Use a small ASCII diagram only when it makes a relationship easier to understand.
- Give an example when a command, API, configuration value, or workflow can otherwise be unclear.
- Explain an external term, flag, or mode on its first use when the reader might not know it.
- Before handover, check affected documentation for accuracy, current links, and enough context for the next reader to continue.
- Do not make documentation so short that it hides purpose, ownership, operation, or the next useful reference.
- Update the related documentation in the same pull request as a behavior, interface, operation, or layout change.

## Validation and handover

- Mandatory: Review every changed line before you make a commit. Remove complexity that the change introduces or exposes only when the work stays within task scope.
- For Go code, use the [Go code review guide](llm/go-code-review-guide.md). See [agent tooling setup](llm/README.md) for related skills.
- Validate untrusted input at its boundary. Use concrete types in trusted code.
- Remove unnecessary helpers, wrappers, forwarding layers, generic maps, interfaces, and defensive fallbacks when they do not represent a real need.
- Keep valid error handling, boundary validation, cleanup, synchronization, and security checks.
- Before handover, run the relevant formatter, tests, and static checks. Run the full component suite when feasible. Report targeted checks and their limits when it is not.
- In the handover, report the result, changed paths, and verification. Explain implementation details only when the user asks or the reason is not clear.

## Commits and pull requests

### Commits

- Use a short Conventional Commit subject: `type(scope): Sentence case`.
- Use a kebab-case scope and one of `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `build`, or `chore`.
- Do not add an AI co-author, session data, or agent data.

### Pull requests

- For now, use the same Conventional Commit format for the pull request title.
- Keep the description short and use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English.
- Follow the validation and handover rules before you write the description.
- State what changed and why it matters. Do not narrate the implementation.
- Group related changes. Include visual evidence only for visual changes.

For a bug fix, use this structure:

```text
## Issue
<One sentence that states the user-visible or operational problem.>

## Summary
<1 or 2 sentences that state the fix and why it matters.>

## Why
<The technical or business reason for this approach.>

## What changed
- <Specific change>

## Screenshots
<Before and after evidence. Omit this section when it does not apply.>

## Related issues
Closes #<issue>
```

For a feature, use this structure:

```text
## Summary
<1 or 2 sentences that state the capability and why it matters.>

## Why
<The technical or business reason for this approach.>

## What changed
- <Specific change>

## Screenshots
<Before and after evidence. Omit this section when it does not apply.>

## Related issues
Refs #<issue>
```

## Agent tooling

Use the most specific available skill for the task. See [Frappe skills](llm/README.md#frappe-skills), [review skills](llm/README.md#review-skills), and [focused output](llm/README.md#focused-output) for sources and installation commands.

### Frappe skills

Use these skills when they are installed:

| Skill | Use for |
|---|---|
| `quality-code-review` | Frappe correctness, security, performance, concurrency, readability, API design, and test reviews. |
| `code-style` | All code edits and code-style questions. |
| `technical-writing` | Documentation, READMEs, commits, pull requests, and release notes in Simplified Technical English. |
| `ui-design` | General UI and UX work. |

Do not use `frappe-app-dev`.

### Review skills

Use `grill-me` for a strict review before you hand over a change.

Use `write-pr-description` to draft a structured pull request description.

Use `i-have-adhd` for focused, action-first output. Invoke it with your agent's skill command.

### Other skills

- `fastapi`: Use for FastAPI routes and Pydantic models.
- `ste100-writer`: Use for controlled technical English and operational documentation.
- `imagegen`: Use when a task needs a generated or edited bitmap image.
