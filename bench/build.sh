# Bake the golden bench image — run INSIDE a freshly-provisioned Ubuntu guest
# (spec/08-images.md § golden bench image), uploaded verbatim and run over
# guest-SSH by atlas.atlas.bench_image.build_bench (the sibling of
# proxy.build_proxy). This is the PROVEN recipe (llm/references/bench-setup.md)
# and nothing more: the whole production stack — MariaDB + Redis + nginx + the
# bench processes — is stood up and MANAGED by `bench init` + `bench start`,
# because bench.toml sets `process_manager = "systemd"`. bench-cli then installs
# `systemctl --user` units, `loginctl enable-linger`s the bench user, and
# enables the bench target, so a snapshot-booted clone comes back up serving
# with NO hand-rolled boot unit, ZFS drop-in, or nginx surgery. Everything the
# old build.sh hand-rolled is now bench-cli's job.
#
# Run as ROOT (the controller SSHes in as root). build.sh runs install.sh as root
# once to create the unprivileged `frappe` user (+ passwordless sudoers) the proven
# recipe uses, then runs install.sh and every bench step AS frappe — the systemd boot
# persistence (linger) is per-user, so it needs a real lingering non-root user, which
# is why root can't bake the bench itself.
#
# TWO MODES (first arg, default `site`):
#   * site  — bake a fully-created Frappe + ERPNext site under the fixed name
#             `site.local` and leave it serving. deploy-site.py `bench rename-site`s
#             `site.local` → `<fqdn>` per clone (rename + nginx + production setup
#             in one), so the DOMAIN MAPS TO THE SITE URL.
#   * admin — bake only the bench + the admin app (no site). deploy sets
#             `[admin].domain = <fqdn>` + `bench setup production` per clone, so the
#             DOMAIN MAPS TO THE ADMIN URL.
# Both modes share one recipe up to the site step; the mode only decides whether
# a site is baked. The per-clone rename / admin-domain mapping lives in
# deploy-site.py — `bench rename-site` (site) or `bench setup production` (admin)
# regenerates nginx to map either correctly.
#
# Idempotent (spec taste #16: retry = re-run): install.sh is clone-or-pull,
# `bench init` is idempotent, and every step below skips when its output exists.

# --- Pins. install.sh clones bench-cli's MOVING main; we check out the exact
# committed ref afterwards so the golden is reproducible (the same discipline
# proxy/build.sh follows). The Frappe branch + the production/MariaDB/ZFS shape
# are pinned in bench.toml.
#
# Pinned at fc89e51 (main @ 2026-07-01). This ref carries the four things this
# build/deploy flow now depends on: (1) the two-path install.sh — run as root it
# creates the bench user + sudoers, run as the user it installs bench-cli (so we no
# longer hand-roll useradd/sudoers); (2) `bench rename-site` (deploy-site.py renames
# the baked site through it — ABSENT before commit 0bc54f2, so an older pin breaks
# the deploy); (3) nginx emits `listen [::]:80` for every site + admin vhost (since
# dd14ad4), so the Atlas v6-only inbound path is served by bench-cli itself — no
# v6-listener / default_server surgery here; (4) `bench generate-admin-session`
# (Pilot #117, merged as 35ae14e) — the admin-mode login-URL handoff.
#
# BENCH_CLI_REF / ERPNEXT_BRANCH are ENV OVERRIDES: the controller
# (atlas.atlas.image_builder) exports them per recipe so one committed build.sh
# bakes any Frappe version (v15 / v16 / nightly). The Frappe branch + Python
# version are pinned in bench.toml (rendered by the controller before upload).
# The defaults below keep a direct `build.sh` run (no env) reproducible at v16. ---

# copies the PREBUILT zfs.ko + spl.ko from the manifest-pinned linux-modules-<kver>

# here rather than assume the base carries it. It lands in the golden bench snapshot
# (a superset of the base), not the base image. Without it the bake dies at install.sh
# `Cloning bench-cli` with `git: command not found` (exit 127).

# --- 3. Install bench-cli — install.sh creates the bench user too (bench-setup.md
# §3+§4). install.sh has two paths (bench-cli @ 03a4272 install.sh): run AS ROOT it
# creates the `$BENCH_USER` (`useradd -m`, adds to sudo) + writes a visudo-validated
# `/etc/sudoers.d/$BENCH_USER` (passwordless), then STOPS; run AS THAT USER it clones
# bench-cli to ~/bench-cli, installs uv + Node + tzdata, adds bench-cli to PATH, and
# sets up the .admin-venv (flask/psutil/pymysql/gunicorn). So we no longer hand-roll
# useradd/usermod/sudoers — the root call does it (no explicit uid; frappe takes the
# next free uid). We then check out the pinned ref so the golden is reproducible
# (install.sh tracks moving main).
#
# Idempotent: the root call is a no-op-ish re-run (user exists → skips useradd,
# rewrites the same sudoers); the user call runs install.sh only on a FRESH guest (no
# bench-cli dir yet) — a re-run must NOT re-invoke it, as install.sh `git pull`s to
# self-update and FATALs on the detached HEAD the pin below leaves ("not currently on
# a branch"). Re-running just re-fetches + re-pins the ref. ---

# below), even though [production] is configured here. `bench start` only checks and

# bench.toml. (The interactive `bench start` → browser setup-wizard flow in
# bench-setup-manual.md is for an operator at a terminal; a bake has no browser.) The

# after drop / as the create-failure rollback; `wildcard-domains` / `proxy-servers`

# is by source address). No-ops cleanly (register exits 0, host queries print blank)
