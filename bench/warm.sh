# Arm the golden bench VM for a WARM capture — run INSIDE the guest over
# guest-SSH by the Image Build warm finalize, AFTER build.sh, immediately BEFORE
# warm-snapshot-vm.py freezes it. build.sh already left the production stack UP
# and serving (its `bench start` under systemd-mode); a warm capture freezes that
# running stack, so whatever is resident in RAM at the pause is what every
# restored clone wakes into.
#
# This is deliberately small. The bench stack, nginx (with v6 listeners), and
# MariaDB are all bench-cli's job and already up — the ONLY per-clone deploy work
# on a warm resume is `mv site.local <fqdn>` + `bench setup nginx` (deploy-site.py).
# So warm.sh does just three things the freeze itself needs:
#
#   1. Install + start the identity freshen unit (atlas-warm-freshen.py): it must
#      be ALIVE mid-loop at the capture instant so every clone wakes with it
#      running and adopts its own identity from MMDS.
#   2. Pre-warm with REAL localhost HTTP (login + /app + pings) so gunicorn
#      workers, the MariaDB buffer pool, compiled assets, and bootinfo are
#      resident in the frozen RAM (and the asset cache lands on the captured disk).
#   3. Clone-entropy hygiene (delete the systemd random-seed) + a final `sync` so
#      everything written here is on the crash-consistent disk the cold-boot
#      FALLBACK uses, not only in the frozen page cache.
#
# Takes the build VM's uuid as $1 (written to /etc/atlas-vm-uuid: the freshen
# unit's "identity already adopted" marker — a clone whose MMDS uuid matches it
# does nothing, so the golden itself never self-freshens). Idempotent. Run as root
# (identity adoption is a root concern); the one bench command runs as frappe.
