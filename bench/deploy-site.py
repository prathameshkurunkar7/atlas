# Deploy ONE Frappe site into a golden bench VM — run INSIDE the guest over
# guest-SSH (spec/14-self-serve.md), driven by the controller
# `atlas.atlas.deploy_site.deploy_site`. The golden image (spec/08-images.md)
# already baked bench-cli + `bench init` AND a fully-created site under the fixed
# name `site.local`; this script does only the per-site work the image can't bake
# because it carries the routing identity (Contract A): RENAME the baked site to
# `<fqdn>` + reset its Administrator password + the production bring-up so the
# bench's own nginx serves the site on :80.
#
# Why rename, not `bench new-site`: in bench-cli a site's identity IS its
# directory name under `sites/` (nginx's `server_name` is the dir name; Frappe
# resolves the Host header to `sites/<host>/`; the db name lives in that dir's
# `site_config.json` and travels with the move). So the per-site step is a
# sub-second directory move + an nginx regen, NOT the multi-minute schema create
# + frappe install `bench new-site` pays — that is baked once into the image.
#
# This ships in the committed `bench/` tree (beside build.sh), uploaded verbatim
# and run over guest-SSH — the same idiom as build.sh. It is self-contained
# (stdlib only, no host `scripts/lib`): the guest never has the Atlas package, so
# the typed-task shape (kebab-case flags via argparse, one `ATLAS_RESULT={json}`
# line out) is inlined here rather than imported.
#
# Run as root with the baked PATH (build.sh wrote /etc/profile.d/atlas-bench.sh,
# but an SSH `command` is non-interactive and does NOT source profile.d, so the
# controller invokes us with an explicit interpreter + the bench-cli path passed
# in). Idempotent (spec taste #14: retry = re-run): a site already at <fqdn> is
# left in place and re-asserted serving, never re-renamed or double-created.
