# Deploy ONE Frappe site into a golden bench VM — run INSIDE the guest over
# guest-SSH (spec/14-self-serve.md), driven by the controller
# `atlas.atlas.deploy_site.deploy_site`. The golden image (spec/08-images.md)
# already baked bench-cli + `bench init` AND a fully-created site under the fixed
# name `site.local`, brought up production-style and (warm) frozen serving. So the
# ONLY per-VM work the image can't bake is giving that baked site its per-VM
# identity — the FQDN — on disk.
#
# RENAME model (Contract A): the baked `site.local` is renamed to the per-VM FQDN
# at deploy time, so the on-disk site name == the proxy Host header == the Site
# key (one routing string, never transformed). The production gunicorn is
# MULTITENANT — `frappe.app:application` runs with no fixed `--site`, so it
# resolves the site from the request `Host` header PER REQUEST (frappe/app.py
# `get_site_name(request.host)`), with nothing cached at boot. The proxy forwards
# `Host: <fqdn>`, so once `sites/<fqdn>` exists on disk and the bench's nginx vhost
# carries `server_name <fqdn>`, the running gunicorn serves it with NO restart.
# The deploy is `bench new-site`-free (baked) and `set-admin-password`-free — the
# baked Administrator password is a long random secret generated at bake time and
# never surfaced. Instead, site mode mints a one-click session URL with
# `bench browse --user Administrator` (a real 24h session, no password);
# admin mode mints one with `bench generate-admin-session --full-path` (Pilot #117,
# a 5-minute single-use JWT). Either way the result carries `login_url` — the only
# way in besides a password the tenant/operator sets themselves later.
#
# The rename is one bench-cli command: `bench rename-site <old> <new>`
# (bench-setup-manual.md) moves the site dir, updates the site config, regenerates
# nginx (`server_name <fqdn>`, `root .../sites/<fqdn>/public`, on both `listen 80;`
# and `listen [::]:80;` — bench-cli emits the v6 listener itself, the edge proxy
# reaches the VM over its public /128 only), and re-runs production setup for the
# new domain. Production setup is idempotent, so it is a fast no-op on a clone that
# was baked production-style — no full rebuild, no per-clone nginx surgery here.
#
# This ships in the committed `bench/` tree (beside build.sh), uploaded verbatim
# and run over guest-SSH — the same idiom as build.sh. It is self-contained
# (stdlib only, no host `scripts/lib`): the guest never has the Atlas package, so
# the typed-task shape (kebab-case flags via argparse, one `ATLAS_RESULT={json}`
# line out) is inlined here rather than imported.
#
# Run as root with the baked PATH (build.sh wrote /etc/profile.d/atlas-bench.sh,
# but an SSH `command` is non-interactive and does NOT source profile.d, so the
# controller invokes us with an explicit interpreter + the bench-cli path passed
# in). Idempotent (spec taste #14: retry = re-run): a re-run finds `sites/<fqdn>`
# already in place (the baked `site.local` is gone) and just re-asserts the vhost
# + serving.

	site mode: the baked `site.local` is renamed to the per-VM FQDN, so the on-disk
	site name == the proxy Host header == the Site key (Contract A). The production
	gunicorn is multitenant (no `--site`), resolving the site from the request `Host`
	per request, so the rename + the regenerated `server_name <fqdn>` vhost take
	effect with NO restart.

	admin mode: no site is baked; instead `[admin].domain` is set to the FQDN so the
	regenerated nginx admin vhost routes the FQDN to the socket-activated admin app.

	The deploy is: (warm) gate on the identity freshen → (cold) ensure `bench start`
	→ map the FQDN — site mode `bench rename-site`s the baked dir to the FQDN (rename
	+ nginx + production setup in one); admin mode sets [admin].domain then
	`bench setup production`. Production setup is idempotent, so a clone baked
	production-style re-runs it as a fast no-op (v6 listener included by bench-cli) →
	local serving probe. No `set-admin-password` (the baked throwaway is rotated out
	of band). Every bench command runs as the `frappe` user (the bake user).

	A warm clone (resumed from a memory snapshot) is already serving; a cold clone
	(snapshot-booted) idempotently re-asserts `bench start` first.
