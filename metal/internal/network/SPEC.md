# network: VM and host network

For Go code, follow the repository [Go anti-pattern rules](../../../llm/go-code-review-guide.md).

[internal SPEC](../SPEC.md) · overview: [docs/networking.md](../../docs/networking.md)

## Purpose

Every virtual machine gets the same private addresses. That is safe because each VM owns a network namespace. Fixed values and values derived from the VM user ID remove the need for an address allocator.

This package makes one virtual machine network agree with its desired state, and it applies the host WireGuard peer set.

## Terms

- A network namespace is one isolated Linux network stack.
- A TAP connects Firecracker to the guest network.
- A veth pair connects a namespace to the host.
- MASQUERADE gives source network address translation.
- A tc policer drops traffic above a rate. It does not queue it.

## Types

| Type | Owns |
|---|---|
| `LinuxAllocator` | Convergence of one VM network. Implements `vm.Network`. |
| `Mesh` | Registration of VM addresses through the Atlas WG Mesh CLI. |
| `WireGuardManager` | The managed peer set of one WireGuard interface. |
| [`traffic.Monitor`](traffic/SPEC.md) | Traffic samples and packet events for monitored VMs. |

## Convergence

For one virtual machine network, `Ensure` is the only entry point. It reads the host and makes the host match. It does not store applied network state.

```text
Ensure
  |
  +- ensureNamespace      create the namespace when absent
  +- ensureNamespaceBase  loopback, TAP, gateway address
  +- convergeFirewall     IPv4 and IPv6 filter tables
  +- removeUnwanted       what this request no longer asks for
  +- addWanted            veth -> internet path -> public IPv4 -> mesh
  +- traffic control      policers on the namespace end of the veth
```

Removal comes before addition, so a change of egress mode never leaves both shapes in place at once. Within `addWanted` the order is load bearing: the veth carries everything above it, and the mesh registration announces the VM, so it is last and the first packet it attracts finds a complete path.

A failed step leaves the partial host state. The next `Ensure` continues from it, so every step must accept a resource that already exists.

| Egress | veth pair | Internet path | Public IPv4 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `uplink` | present | present | optional |
| `mesh` | present | absent | rejected |
| `none` | absent | absent | rejected |

`Release` removes the mesh registration first, because deleting the namespace also deletes the veth pair the registration names.

## Firewall

The firewall owns the filter tables inside the VM network namespace. It filters both public and mesh traffic before packets reach `tap0`.

An enabled firewall gives `FORWARD` a default drop policy. It accepts established and related connections before it evaluates allow rules. An empty direction permits no new connection in that direction. A disabled firewall gives `FORWARD` an accept policy and keeps the desired rules for later use.

Each allow rule selects `any`, `tcp`, `udp`, or `icmp`. A TCP or UDP rule can select one destination port or one inclusive destination port range. An empty port value selects all ports. Each rule has one or more canonical IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes.

Metal reads both filter tables before it applies a firewall change. Metal replaces only tables that differ. If the second table update fails, Metal restores the first table to prevent a split policy. A new namespace and a changed effective firewall cause an immediate inspection. An unchanged firewall has a drift audit once per minute. The memory-only audit cache is not applied state. A process restart causes a new inspection.

Metal applies the firewall before it adds the veth, public address, or mesh registration. Existing tracked connections continue because the first enabled rule accepts `ESTABLISHED,RELATED` traffic.

## Host rules

Public IPv4 needs 5 rules across 2 network stacks: DNAT in, SNAT out, both conntrack directions, and a second DNAT inside the namespace. They are treated as one set. If any rule is missing, all are removed and rewritten, so a partial set from an interrupted run cannot survive.

Every rule carries the comment `metal-public-ipv4-<vm-id>`. Cleanup finds rules by that comment, which is why no rule state is kept anywhere.

`iptables` fails on a duplicate add and on a delete of an absent rule, so each change tests with `-C` first. Exit code 1 means absent; any other failure is an error, so a broken check never reads as absent.

## Traffic control

Policers go on the namespace end of the veth. The host end belongs to Atlas WG Mesh and its terminating direct-action program, so each component owns one end and neither can displace the other.

The VM is inside the namespace, so `egress` carries traffic away from it and matches the destination, while `ingress` carries traffic toward it and matches the source.

Private filters take a lower `tc` priority than the public filter, which matches every IPv4 address. A private packet therefore stops at the private policer. One priority holds one protocol, so private IPv4 and IPv6 need separate priorities.

Private traffic is the RFC 1918 IPv4 ranges `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, and `192.168.0.0/16`, plus the IPv6 unique-local range `fc00::/7`, which contains every mesh prefix. Public traffic is every other IPv4 address.

## Traffic tracking

When traffic monitoring is enabled, the [traffic SPEC](traffic/SPEC.md) owns traffic samples and packet events. `LinuxAllocator` gives it the namespace path and TAP name after the namespace converges, and releases the attachment before it deletes the namespace.

A stopped guest cannot answer ARP or neighbour discovery. Metal pins both guest addresses to the fixed guest MAC:

```text
fixed guest IPv4 ---+
                    +-> guest MAC -> tap0
per-VM mesh IPv6 ---+
```

`ensureNamespaceBase` owns the IPv4 entry. Mesh setup owns the IPv6 entry. Both paths can deliver an IP packet while Firecracker is stopped.

## Atlas WG Mesh

When Atlas WG Mesh is enabled, it assumes the VM sits directly behind the interface it hooks. A namespace sits between them, so the namespace forwards IPv6 and answers neighbour solicitations for the guest with proxy NDP.

`EnsureHost` configures an unconfigured host and refuses a host that discovers on another interface, because the uplink hook consumes the discovery traffic of every VLAN beneath it.

`ApplyPrivilegedAddresses` and `WireGuardManager.Apply` each replace a complete set. `Apply` drops this host from the peer set it receives and records what it applied, so it never peers with itself and never disturbs peers added by other tools.
