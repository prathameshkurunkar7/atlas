# firecracker: VM runtime

For Go code, follow the repository [Go anti-pattern rules](../../../llm/go-code-review-guide.md).

[internal SPEC](../SPEC.md) · overview: [docs/architecture.md](../../docs/architecture.md)

## Purpose

This package does not own a VM process. systemd does. Each VM is a unit of the `metal-vm@` template, so a crash of metald leaves running guests alone, and a restart of metald finds them by asking systemd rather than by remembering anything.

What this package owns is everything inside that unit: the jail, the boot configuration, the guest metadata, and the API conversation with Firecracker. It implements `vm.Runtime` and holds no VM records.

## Types

| Type | Owns |
|---|---|
| `Runtime` | The `vm.Runtime` implementation and the host services it needs. |
| `machine` | One VM for the length of one operation. Binds a unit and an API client. |
| `Config` | Host directories and executable paths. |

`Runtime` also satisfies `vm.WarmRuntime`, which supplies Firecracker build identity and memory snapshot capture.

## Composition

```text
vm.Manager -> firecracker.Runtime -> systemd -> jailer -> Firecracker
                         |
                         +-> VM disk storage
                         +-> image storage
                         +-> serial broker
```

## Jail

Everything one VM owns lives under its own directory, so removing that directory removes the jail, the chroot, and the jailer environment together. The kernel is hard linked into the chroot, which is why the chroot base sits beside the VM files rather than on another file system.

The jailer arguments reach systemd through an `EnvironmentFile`. systemd word splits that value, so no argument may contain a space. Firecracker's API socket lives inside the chroot at a fixed relative path, and a symlink outside gives metald a short path to dial.

## Launch

Cold and warm launch share one preparation step:

```text
write the jailer environment and the socket link
open the console PTY          before the unit starts, so no output is lost
start the systemd unit
persist the console master    after the unit holds the PTY slave
set unit resource limits
wait for the API socket       the process belongs to systemd, so this is the only signal
    |
    +- cold: prepare the disk, then configure machine, kernel, drives, network, MMDS
    +- warm: prepare the disk from the warm snapshot, load state and memory, resume
```

A jail is never reused. Each launch discards the previous one, because leftover state is harder to reason about than a rebuild.

The VM specification stores CPU entitlement in millicores. Firecracker receives the entitlement rounded up to a whole guest-vCPU count. For example, 1500 millicores creates 2 guest vCPUs. The API maximum is 32000 millicores because Firecracker supports at most 32 guest vCPUs. systemd applies the exact entitlement as a CPU quota, so rounding the guest topology does not increase available CPU time.

The runtime has explicit start operations:

```text
Start         -> shared warm image -> failure -> cold boot
ColdStart     -> cold boot, never a warm image
Restore       -> VM saved state -> resume
RestorePaused -> VM saved state -> stay paused
```

`Start` uses a warm image only when the image and derived guest-vCPU count, memory, and disk match. It cold boots if warm launch fails. `ColdStart` always cold boots, so a migrated disk never inherits the source guest memory. `Restore` returns an error instead of cold booting. This protects the saved guest state. Metadata is updated before a restored guest can run.

`RefreshDisk` applies the configured disk limits to a live guest. `LimitDiskThroughput` applies a temporary combined read and write bandwidth limit to a live drive during a migration, and `RefreshDisk` restores the configured limit. A value of zero or less does nothing, so a caller never clears the limit by accident. Both do nothing when the VM is not running or paused.

A memory snapshot restores only into the Firecracker build that wrote it. The binary reports no version, so its size and modification time stand in for one.

## Saved state

A saved state contains `state`, `memory`, and `metadata.json`. It belongs to one VM and is separate from shared warm image artifacts.

```text
running -> pause -> jail/saved-state-pending/{state,memory,metadata.json}
					|
					v
		  machines/<id>/saved-state/
					|
					+-> terminate Firecracker -> stopped

stopped -> copy state to new jail -> load -> update guest metadata -> resume
```

The metadata records VM identity, record generations, Firecracker compatibility, creation time, fixed file names, and file sizes. Restore paths come from the VM ID.

Metal validates the files and publishes the pending directory with one atomic rename. Only one saved state can exist for one VM.

The saved state is published before Firecracker stops. This makes `SaveAndStop` safe to retry:

| Runtime state | Valid snapshot | Result |
|---|---|---|
| stopped | yes | Save and stop is complete. |
| paused | yes | Terminate Firecracker. |
| running | yes | Report a conflict. |

A restore removes the saved state only after the new jail loads its copy. `Stop`, restart, remove, or an incompatible machine shape deletes the saved state. Inspection reports an invalid saved state as an error.

A requested restore never falls back to a cold boot. It can also load the guest in a paused state.

## State

State comes from two places. systemd owns whether the process runs, and Firecracker owns what the guest does inside it. Only an active unit is worth asking:

```text
failed                  -> failed
inactive, deactivating  -> stopped
active -> Firecracker instance state
             Not started -> created
             Running     -> running
             Paused      -> paused
```

Anything else reads as `unknown`, and an API fault returns `unknown` with an error rather than a guess.

`Stop` asks the guest to power off and kills it when it does not answer. It deletes saved state. `SaveAndStop` pauses the guest, saves its state, and stops Firecracker.

`Remove` stops the unit and removes runtime-owned files, including VM saved state. The manager releases network and storage.

## Guest metadata

Firecracker serves MMDS to the guest. This package builds that document, so nothing per VM is baked into an image and one image serves every VM. Metadata is replaced in place on a live guest and rewritten on every launch.

## SSH console

An SSH session authorizes itself with a throwaway key pair: the public key is pushed into MMDS, `ssh` runs inside the VM network namespace on a PTY, and the key is removed when the session closes. No key outlives a session, and the guest image carries none. Sessions are capped host-wide.
