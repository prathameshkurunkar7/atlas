## Purpose

Almost nothing here waits for the host. A mutation validates its request, stores desired state, wakes the reconciler, and returns. The controller learns the outcome by polling, not by holding a connection open.

That is why this package is thin: it owns request validation, the public response shape, and the mapping from domain errors to status codes. It owns no VM, image, or host state.

## Types

`New(Config, Dependencies)` validates configuration and dependencies, then returns a configured Echo router. `Server` holds the injected services and every handler.

`Dependencies` carries the VM manager, migration manager, snapshot store, host service, wake function, serial broker, and trusted key store. Each is an interface declared here, so this package depends on no implementation.

## Request flow

```text
correlation -> log -> group authentication -> handler
                                                 |
                             decode strict JSON -+
                             validate            |
                             call a service      |
                             wake the reconciler |
                             respond ------------+
```

Correlation runs first, so every log line and every error carries the same IDs. Each request gets an `X-Request-ID` and an `X-Operation-ID`, returned as response headers and included in logs. A caller-supplied value is kept when it is safe to echo, and replaced when it is not.

JSON decoding is strict: unknown fields and trailing values are rejected, so a misspelled field fails instead of being silently dropped. Bodies are size capped.

## Routes

```text
GET    /health                    public
GET    /docs                      public
GET    /docs/swagger.json         public

POST   /v1/sync

PUT    /v1/vms/:id                create, idempotent on the caller's ID
GET    /v1/vms
GET    /v1/vms/:id
PUT    /v1/vms/:id/power
POST   /v1/vms/:id/restart
PUT    /v1/vms/:id/compute
PUT    /v1/vms/:id/disk
PUT    /v1/vms/:id/network
PUT    /v1/vms/:id/ssh-keys
PUT    /v1/vms/:id/metadata
DELETE /v1/vms/:id
GET    /v1/vms/:id/console        mode=tty (default) or mode=ssh

POST   /v1/vms/:id/snapshots
POST   /v1/snapshots/:id/upload
GET    /v1/snapshots/:id
DELETE /v1/snapshots/:id

PUT    /v1/migrations/:id          Atlas creates or resumes a target, static token
GET    /v1/migrations/:id          Atlas reads target status, static token
POST   /v1/migrations/:id/abort    Atlas aborts a target, static token
POST   /v1/migrations/:id/finish   Atlas records the target finish, static token
PUT    /v1/migrations/:id/source   the target locks the source, mesh
POST   /v1/migrations/:id/snapshot the target asks for the next snapshot, mesh
POST   /v1/migrations/:id/stop     the target stops the source and gets the final snapshot, mesh
POST   /v1/migrations/:id/start    the target restores the source during rollback, mesh
POST   /v1/migrations/:id/destroy  the target destroys the stopped source, mesh
DELETE /v1/migrations/:id          the target unlocks the source, mesh
```

Atlas drives create, get, abort, and finish with the static token. The target host drives source, snapshot, stop, start, destroy, and delete on the source host over the trusted mesh with no credential. Every source route carries the VM ID as the `virtual_machine_id` query value, so the source resolves the migration without a token. The disk itself moves over a separate TCP connection, not an HTTP route. See [internal/vm_migration/SPEC.md](../vm_migration/SPEC.md).

The stop route normalizes the source to stopped, removes its network, and returns the final snapshot in the snapshot response form. It is idempotent.

The finish route records the target finish request and returns `202`. Atlas calls it with the static token. The target then destroys the source with the destroy route over the mesh. The destroy route removes the stopped source and returns `204`. The start route restores the source to its original desired state during a rollback and returns `204`.

PUT is used wherever a request replaces desired state, so a repeat is safe. POST is used only for an action that must happen again even when nothing changed, such as a restart, or for creating an addressable resource, such as a snapshot.

The network PUT requires the complete network object, including `firewall`. Firewall rules are allow rules. The API validates protocols, ports, canonical IP prefixes, and the limit of 50 prefix entries.

## Capacity

Compute and disk updates are checked against host memory and storage before they are stored, and an increase the host cannot satisfy is refused with `409`. Only the increase is checked, because the VM already holds what it reserves. CPU entitlement is oversubscribed, so a CPU increase is always accepted when `cpu_millicores` is in the valid range from 100 through 32000.

Nothing else is checked this way: the remaining fields do not consume a host resource.

## Status codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200` | The request completed synchronously. |
| `201` | A snapshot exists. `Location` names where to fetch it. |
| `202` | Desired state is stored. Reconciliation continues. |
| `204` | Removed, with nothing to return. |

SSH key and metadata replacement try to reach a live guest first, within a short timeout, and report `200` when they succeed. A timeout is not a failure: the desired record is already stored, so `202` means the next reconcile pass applies it. The timeout belongs to [internal/vm/SPEC.md](../vm/SPEC.md).

## Authentication

Each route group names the middleware it needs, so a route cannot inherit the wrong rule.

| Middleware | Credential | Routes |
|---|---|---|
| `authenticate` | The static bearer token. Only its SHA-256 digest is configured, so the plain token never reaches this package, and the comparison is constant time. | The `/v1` controller group. |
| none | The trusted WireGuard mesh. | The source-side migration routes that one Metal host calls on another. |

The source-side migration routes carry no credential. Metal hosts reach each other only over the trusted mesh, so a source route trusts its caller and reads the VM ID from the `virtual_machine_id` query value.

Group authentication makes the group answer every path below it. An unknown path and a wrong method under `/v1` both return `404`.

The 3 public routes carry no VM data. Liveness must answer a probe that holds no token, and the documentation page is opened in a browser that cannot send one. Both stay open, so metald is expected to listen on a private control network.

## Errors

A domain error is mapped to one status and one safe message. An unrecognized error becomes `500` with no detail, and its cause is logged under the request ID the response carries back.

| Domain error | Status | Code |
|---|---|---|
| `vm.ErrNotFound`, `storage.ErrNotFound` | `404` | `not_found` |
| `vm.ErrConflict`, `storage.ErrInUse` | `409` | `conflict` |
| `storage.ErrImageConflict` | `409` | `image_content_conflict` |
| `storage.ErrImageIntegrity` | `422` | `image_integrity_failed` |
| `storage.ErrShuttingDown` | `503` | `unavailable` |
| `network.ErrInvalidPeers`, `storage.ErrInvalidUpload` | `400` | `invalid_request` |
| `token.ErrUnauthorized` | `401` | `unauthorized` |
| `token.ErrForbidden` | `403` | `forbidden` |
| `token.ErrInvalidKeys` | `400` | `invalid_request` |
| `token.ErrKeyConflict` | `409` | `conflict` |

Every error body carries a `retryable` flag, so a caller does not have to know which statuses are worth another attempt. `501` is excluded: repeating it cannot change the answer.

`POST /v1/sync` addresses no resource, so it maps a not-found from host state to `503` `unavailable`. A `404` would tell the controller to stop when it must try the request again.

Responses never carry host command output, signed URL query values, or local error detail.

## Response shape

A VM response nests `desired` and `observed`. The controller compares their generations to know when a change is applied, so both are always returned together.

A response omits what the controller must not see or cannot use: transport URLs, user data, host paths, process IDs, and host user IDs.
